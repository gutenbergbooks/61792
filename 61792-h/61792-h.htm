<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The purpose of the present work is to study what is known of one
of the most important genres of Greek sculpture—the monuments
erected at Olympia and elsewhere in the Greek world in honor of
victorious athletes at the Olympic games. Since only meagre remnants
of these monuments have survived, the work is in the main concerned
with the attempt to reconstruct their various types and poses.</p>

<p>The source-material on which the attempt is based has been
indicated fully in the text; it is of two kinds, literary and archæological.
To the former belong the explanatory inscriptions on the
bases of victor statues found at Olympia and elsewhere, many of which
agree verbally with epigrams preserved in the <i>Greek Anthologies</i>; the
incidental statements of various kinds and value found in the classical
writers and their scholiasts; and, above all, the detailed works of the
two imperial writers, the elder Pliny and Pausanias. Pliny’s account
of the Greek artists, which is inserted into his <i>Historia Naturalis</i> as a
digression (Books <span class="smcap">XXXIV-XXXVI</span>)—being artificially joined to the
history of mineralogy on the pretext of the materials used—is,
despite its uncritical and often untrustworthy character, one of our
chief mines of information about Greek sculptors and painters. The
portions of Pausanias’ <i>Description of Greece</i> which deal with Elis and
the monuments of Olympia (Books <span class="smcap">V-VI</span>), although they also evince
little real understanding of art, are of far more direct importance to
our subject, since they include a descriptive catalogue, doubtless
based upon personal observation, of the greater part of the athlete
monuments set up in the Altis at Olympia, the reconstruction of
which is the chief purpose of the present work.</p>

<p>To the archæological sources, on the other hand, belong, first and
foremost, the remnants of victor statues in stone and metal which have
long been garnered in modern museums or have come to light during
the excavation of the Altis. To this small number I hope I have
added at least one marble fragment found at Olympia, the head of a
statue by Lysippos, the last great sculptor of Greece (<a href="#fr">Frontispiece</a> and
Fig. <a href="#f69">69</a>). To this second kind of sources belong also the statue bases
just mentioned, on many of which the extant footmarks enable us to
determine the poses of the statues themselves which once stood upon
them. Furthermore, an intimate knowledge of Greek athletic sculpture
in all its periods and phases is, of course, essential in treating a
problem of this nature. Here, as in the study of Greek sculpture in
general, where the destruction of original masterpieces, apart from the
few well-known but splendid exceptions, has been complete, we are
almost entirely dependent upon second-hand evidence furnished by
the numerous existing antique copies and adaptations of lost originals
executed in marble and bronze by more or less skilled workmen for
the Roman market.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv">iv</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, not only are the innumerable statuettes and small bronzes
surviving from antiquity of great value in any attempt to reconstruct
the pose of a given athlete statue, but also the representations of
various athlete figures on every sort of sculptured and painted work—vase-paintings,
wall-paintings, reliefs, gems, coins, etc.</p>

<p>By using all such sources of information, it is possible to attain
tolerable certainty in reconstructing the various types and poses of
these lost monuments, and in identifying schools of athletic sculpture,
masters, and even individual statues. But it must be stated at the
outset that such identifications, from the very nature of the problem,
are at best tentative in character. The attempt to see in Roman
copies certain statues of athletes has often been made by archæologists.
However probable such identifications may seem, we must not forget
the simple fact that up to the present time not a single Roman copy
has been conclusively <i>proved</i> to be that of an Olympic victor statue.
Only as our knowledge of Greek sculpture is gradually extended by
discoveries of additional works of art, and by future researches, will it
be possible to attain an ever greater degree of probability. The further
identification of these important monuments, as that of masterpieces of
Greek sculpture generally, will thus remain one of the chief problems
for the future archæologist. In the present book, where the body of
material drawn upon is so immense and the scientific writings involved
are so voluminous, manifestly the author can lay no claim to an exhaustive
treatment. With due consciousness of the defects and
shortcomings of the work, he can claim only to have made a small
selection of such works of art as will best illustrate the various types of
monuments under discussion.</p>

<p>The plan of the book is easily seen by a glance at the table of contents.
After a preliminary chapter on the origin and development of
Greek athletic games in general and on the custom of conferring
athletic prizes on victors, the more specific subject of the work is introduced
in Chapter II by brief discussions of the more general characteristics
common to Olympic victor statues—their size, nudity, and hair-fashion,
their portrait or non-portrait features, and the standard of
beauty reached by some of them at least, as shown by the æsthetic
judgments of certain ancient writers and by the fragmentary originals
which have survived. The enumeration of these characteristics is
followed by a brief account of the various canons of proportion
assumed to have been used and taught by different schools of sculptors.
The chapter ends with a more extended account of the little-known but
important subject of the assimilation of this class of monuments to
athlete types of gods and heroes.</p>

<p>In Chapters III and IV, which are the most important in developing
the problem of reconstruction, a division has been made into two
great statuary groups: those in which the victor was represented at rest,
where the particular contest was indicated, if indicated at all, by very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v">v</a></span>
general motives or by particular athletic attributes; and those in which
the victor was represented in movement, <i>i. e.</i>, in the characteristic pose
of the contest in which he won his victory.</p>

<p>Chapter V relates chiefly to the monuments of hippodrome victors,
those in the various chariot-races and horse-races, and ends with a very
brief notice of non-athlete victor dedications—those of musicians.</p>

<p>Chapter VI gives a stylistic analysis of what are conceived to be two
original marble heads from lost victor statues, one of which is ascribed
to Lysippos, the great bronze-founder and art-reformer of the fourth
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, while the other is regarded as an early Hellenistic work
of eclectic tendencies. The publication of these marble heads and of
the oldest-dated victor statue, which is also of marble and which is
discussed in Chapter VII, reinforced by other evidence adduced in the
latter chapter, overthrows the belief that all victor statues were uniformly
made of bronze. The publication of the Olympia head also
controverts the usual assumption of archæologists that Lysippos
worked only in metal. The last chapter is concerned with a topographical
study of the original positions in the Altis of the various athlete
monuments discussed, and with a list of all the victor monuments
known to have been erected outside Olympia in various cities of the
ancient world. These last three chapters are based on papers which
have already appeared in the <i>American Journal of Archæology</i> (Chapters
VI, VII, and the first half of VIII) and in the <i>Transactions of the
American Philological Association</i> (the last half of Chapter VIII). Permission
to use them in the present book has been kindly granted to the
author by Dr. James A. Paton, former editor-in-chief of the <i>American
Journal of Archæology</i>, and by Professor Clarence P. Bill, the secretary
of the American Philological Association.</p>

<p>Although it has been my aim throughout to present my own views in
regard to the various works of art under discussion, I must, of course,
acknowledge that the book is largely based upon the work and conclusions
of preceding scholars who have treated various phases of the
same subject. It would, however, be unnecessary and even impossible
here to acknowledge all the works laid directly or indirectly under
contribution in the composition of the book. Most of these have been
recorded in the footnotes.</p>

<p>But I wish here to express, in a more general way, my indebtedness
to the standard histories of Greek sculpture, by Brunn, Collignon,
Gardiner, Lechat, Murray, Overbeck, Richardson, and others, which
must form the foundation of the knowledge of any one who writes on
any phase of the subject. Among these, two have been found especially
valuable: Bulle’s <i>Der schoene Mensch im Altertum</i>, which is justly noted
for its comprehensive views and sound judgments; and Furtwaengler’s
<i>Die Meisterwerke der griechischen Plastik</i>, which, although it has been
known to English readers in its enlarged edition by Miss Eugénie Sellers
for over a quarter of a century, is still prized for its extensive first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>hand
knowledge of the monuments and for its brilliant inductions, even
if the latter at times are carried too far.</p>

<p>Perhaps my greatest debt has been to the excellent volume entitled
<i>Greek Athletic Sports and Festivals</i>, by E. Norman Gardiner, M. A., a
scholar whose practical knowledge of modern athletic sports and wide
familiarity with the ancient source material, both literary and monumental,
has well fitted him to deal afresh with the subject treated so
learnedly over three quarters of a century ago in Krause’s <i>Die Gymnastik
und Agonistik der Hellenen</i>. I have also constantly drawn upon
Gardiner’s collection of vase-paintings which illustrate athletic scenes.</p>

<p>I should also note here several other works which have been of
great assistance in writing this book, such as Juethner’s <i>Ueber antike
Turngeraethe</i> and edition of Philostratos’ <i>de Arte gymnastica</i>, Reisch’s
<i>Griechische Weihgeschenke</i>, Rouse’s <i>Greek Votive Offerings</i>, and Foerster’s
<i>Die Sieger in den Olympischen Spielen</i>. The chronological list of
victors in the latter compilation was, in large part, the foundation of
my earlier work <i>de olympionicarum Statuis</i>.</p>

<p>I have also received most valuable help from the standard catalogues
of modern museums, <i>e. g.</i>, those by Amelung, Dickins, Helbig, Kabbadias,
Lechat, Richter, de Ridder, Staïs, Svoronos, and especially the
admirable ones of the classical collections in the British Museum. I
regret that, owing to the recent war, some of the latest catalogues, those
especially of the smaller foreign museums, have not been available.</p>

<p>For illustrative matter, I have made no effort to reproduce merely
striking works of art, but have, for the most part, presented well-known
works which readily illustrate the problems treated in the
text. I have availed myself of collections of photographs kindly placed
at my disposal by Professors Herbert E. Everett of the School of Fine
Arts of the University of Pennsylvania, D. M. Robinson of the Johns
Hopkins University, A. S. Cooley of the Moravian College at Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania, and Dr. Mary H. Swindler of Bryn Mawr College.
The various collections of plates and the books and journals from which
I have taken illustrations are duly noted in the List of Illustrations.</p>

<p>In addition, I wish to thank the following corporations and individuals
for permission to reproduce plates and text-cuts from the works
cited: the Council of the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies,
of London, for the use of four plates appearing in the <i>Journal of
Hellenic Studies</i> (Figs. <a href="#f44">44</a>, <a href="#f54">54</a>, <a href="#f55">55</a>, and <a href="#f59">59</a>); the Trustees of the British
Museum in London for seven plates from <i>Marbles and Bronzes in the
British Museum</i> (Pls. <a href="#p7A">7A</a>, <a href="#p17">17</a>, <a href="#p19">19</a>; Figs. <a href="#f14">14</a>, 28, <a href="#f31">31</a>, and <a href="#f35">35</a>); Professor E.
A. Gardiner and his publishers, Duckworth and Co., of London, for
two plates from <i>Six Greek Sculptors</i> (Pl. <a href="#p30">30</a>; Fig. <a href="#f71">71</a>); Mr. H. R. Hall, of
the British Museum, and his publisher, Philip Lee Warner, of London,

three other text-cuts from the same journal (Figs. <a href="#f70">70</a>, <a href="#f72">72</a>, <a href="#f79">79</a>).</p>

<p>To the following I am also indebted for individual photographs: Dr.
J. N. Svoronos, Director of the Numismatic Museum, Athens, Greece,

<a href="#p27">27</a>; Fig. <a href="#f23">23</a>); Dr. Edward Robinson, of the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, New York, for those of the fine Kresilæan and Praxitelian heads
(Pls. <a href="#p15">15</a>, <a href="#p20">20</a>), and of the bronze statuette of a diskobolos (Fig. <a href="#f46">46</a>);
Prof. Alice Walton, of Wellesley College, for one of the Polykleitan
athlete (Pl. <a href="#p13">13</a>); the Director of the Fogg Art Museum of Cambridge,
Mass., for that of the so-called <i>Meleager</i> (Fig. <a href="#f77">77</a>); Dr. S. B. Luce,
recently of the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania, for photographs
of two vase-paintings showing athletic scenes (Figs. <a href="#f50">50</a>, <a href="#f56">56</a>), and
Dr. Eleanor F. Rambo, formerly of the same Museum, for a copy of
the Knossos wall-painting (Pl. <a href="#p1">1</a>).</p>

<p>A word might be added as to the spelling of Greek proper names.
Since consistency in this matter seems unattainable, I have adopted
the method outlined in the <i>British School Annual</i> (<span class="smcap">XV</span>, 1908–09, p. 402),
whereby the names of persons, places, buildings, festivals, etc., are
transliterated from the Greek forms, except those which have become
a part of the English language. But even here I have sometimes
deviated from the practice of using familiar English forms.</p>

<p>In abbreviations of the names of journals (see pages <span class="smcap">XVI-XIX</span>) I
have largely conformed with the usage long recommended by the
<i>American Journal of Archæology.</i></p>

<p>For convenience in identifying the many works of art, discussed or
mentioned in the text and foot-notes, I have constantly referred to
well-known collections of plates, such as those of Brunn-Bruckmann,
Bulle, Rayet, and von Mach. For further convenience, I have also
in most cases referred to the outline drawings of statues in Reinach’s
<i>Répertoire de la statuaire grecque et romaine</i>, and in some cases to the
older ones found in Clarac’s <i>Musée de sculpture antique et moderne</i>,
and in Mueller and Wieseler’s <i>Denkmaeler der alten Kunst</i>.</p>

<p>In closing, I have the pleasant duty of thanking generally the many
friends who have given me valuable suggestions and assistance, especially
Professor Lane Cooper, of Cornell University, for reading the
proof-sheets of the entire work, and Professor Alfred Emerson, now of
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, my former teacher, for revising the list of
<i>Corrigenda</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>EARLY GREEK GAMES AND PRIZES.</small></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate 1 and Figures 1 and 2.</span></p>

<p>Before attempting to trace historically the development of monuments
of victors in the gymnic and hippic contests at Olympia, and
before attempting to reconstruct their different types, it will be
useful to devote a preliminary chapter to the early history of Greek
athletics and victor prizes in general.</p>

<p>It is a truism that the origin of Greek athletics is not to be found in
the recently discovered Aegean civilization of Crete, nor in the latest
phase of the same culture on Mycenæan sites of the mainland of Greece.
Their origin is not to be sought in the indigenous Mediterranean stock
which produced that culture, but rather among the northern invaders of
Greece, the fair-haired Achæans of the Homeric poems, and especially
among the later Dorians in the Peloponnesus. It was to the physical
vigor of these strangers rather than to the more artistic nature of the
Mediterraneans that the later Greeks owed their interest in sports. As
these invaders settled themselves most firmly in the Peloponnesus, Greek
athletics may be said to be chiefly the product of South Greece. It was
here that three of the four national festivals grew up—at Olympia,
Nemea, and on the Corinthian Isthmus. It was in the schools of Argos
and Sikyon that athletic sculpture flourished best and in later Greek
history physical exercise was most fully developed among the Dorian
Spartans.<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<h3>SPORTS IN CRETE.</h3>

<p>Centuries before the Achæan civilization of Greece had bloomed,
there developed among the Minoans of Crete a passion for certain
acrobatic performances and for gymnastics. These Cretans, though
strongly influenced by Egypt and the East, did not borrow their love
of sport from outside any more than did the later Achæans. On the
walls of the tombs of Beni-Hasan on the Nile are pictured many athletic
sports, including a series of several hundred wrestling groups,<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> but
these sports did not influence, so far as we know, Cretan athletics. At
Knossos bull-grappling seems to have been the national sport, as we
see from the frescoes on the palace walls. In the absence of the horse,
which did not appear in early Aegean times in Crete, it is not difficult
to understand the development of gymnastic sports with bulls. At
Knossos a seal has been found which shows the rude drawing of a vessel
with rowers seated under a canopy, superimposed on which is drawn
the greater portion of a huge horse. In this design, dating from about
1600 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> and synchronizing with the earlier part of the eighteenth
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>Egyptian dynasty, we doubtless see a graphic way of indicating the
cargo, and consequently a contemporary record, it may be, of the first
importation of horses from Libya into Crete.<a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>The Cretan bull seems to have been a much larger animal than the
species found upon the island to-day.<a id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Bull-grappling at Knossos was
the sport of female as well as male toreadors. A fragmentary rectangular
fresco, dating from about 1500 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> (Pl. <a href="#p1">1</a>), was discovered
there by Sir Arthur Evans in 1901 and is now in the Candia museum.
It is executed with extraordinary spirit and shows a huge bull rushing
forward with lowered head and tail straight out. A man is in the act
of turning a somersault on its back, his legs in the air, his arms grasping
the bull’s body and his head raised, looking back to the rear of the
animal, where a cowgirl is standing, holding out her arms to catch his
flying figure as soon as his feat is concluded. Another cowgirl, at the
extreme left, seems to be suspended from the bull’s horns, which pass
under her armpits, while she catches hold further up. However, she
is not being tossed, but is taking position preliminary to leaping over
the bull’s back. Both the man and the women wear striped boots and
bracelets; the women are apparently distinguished by their white skin,
short drawers, yellow sashes embroidered with red, and the red-and-blue
diadems around their brows.[5] On the opposite wall a similar scene
was pictured; among its stucco fragments was found the representation
of the arm and shoulder of a woman grasping a bull by the horns. The
fragmentary representation of another woman and man was also found.</p>

<div class="caption">Bull-grappling Scene. Wall-painting from Knossos. Museum of Candia.
</div></div>

<p>A very similar scene has long been known from a fresco painting
from Tiryns, now in Athens.<a id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> A bull is represented galloping to the
left, while a man<a id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> clings to its horns with his right hand and is swept
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
along with one foot lightly touching the bull’s back and the other
swung aloft. Most early writers interpreted this scene as a bull-hunt,
the artist having drawn the hunter above the bull through ignorance
of perspective. The execution is very inferior, three attempts
of the bungling painter being visible in the painting of the tail and
the front legs. Others saw in it the representation of an acrobat
showing his dexterity by leaping upon the back of an animal in full
career, recalling the description of such a trick in the Iliad, where Ajax
is represented as rushing over the plain like a man who, while driving
four horses, leaps from horse to horse.<a id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> But this figure must take its
place side by side with the one from Knossos just described as another
bull-grappling scene. That such sports were not held in the open air,
but in an enclosed courtyard, is shown by the seal from Praisos now in
the Candia Museum, which depicts a man vaulting on the back of a
gigantic ox within a paved enclosure.<a id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> Doubtless the theatral areas
discovered at Phaistos by the Italian Archæological Mission<a id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> and at
Knossos by Sir Arthur Evans in 1903<a id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> were not large enough for bull
scenes and were used merely for ceremonial dancing and perhaps for
the boxing matches to be described.<a id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Similar acrobats are doubtless
to be recognized in the two beautiful ivory statuettes, only 11.5
inches in height, of so-called leapers, found by Dr. Evans at Knossos
in 1901.<a id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> These masterpieces of the late Minoan II period represent
acrobats (one is probably a woman) darting through the air. “The
life, the freedom, the <i>élan</i> of these figures is nothing short of marvellous,”
writes Dr. Evans, who calls attention to the careful physical
training shown in their slender legs and in the muscles, even the veins
on the back of the hands and the finger-nails being plainly indicated
as well as the details of the skinfolds at the joints. They doubtless
formed a part of an ivory model of the bull-ring and are meant for
miniature toreadors, who were hung in the air by fine gold wires<a id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> over
the backs of ivory bulls who stood on the solid ground. The heads of
the figures are thrown backwards, a posture suitable for such vaulters,
but not for leapers or divers. Minoan art culminated in these statuettes
and in certain stucco figures in half relief found also at Knossos.
Only a few fragments of these reliefs have survived, most of which were
decorative or architectonic in character, though among them were also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
found human <i>disjecta membra</i> in high relief, such as the fragment of a
left forearm holding a horn, and not a pointed vase, as Dr. Evans
thought. Here the muscles are well indicated, though the veins are
exaggerated.<a id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> This fragment may well be a part of the same bull-grappling
scenes as those in the frescoes, as also the life-like image of
a bull, the details of whose head, mouth, eyes, and nostrils are full of
expression, and whose muscles are perfectly indicated.</p>

<p>When compared with the monuments described, the similarity of
details on the design of the Vapheio cups ornamented in repoussé,
the “most splendid specimens known of the work of the Minoan goldsmith,”<a id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
never again equalled until the Italian Renaissance, makes it
more than possible that here again we have scenes of bull-grappling
rather than of bull-hunting. On one cup is represented a quiet pastoral
scene—a man tying the legs of a bull with a rope, while two other
bulls stand near, amicably licking one another, and a third is quietly
grazing. On the other, however, are represented scenes of a very
different character. In the centre is a furious bull entangled in a net,
which is fastened to a tree; to the left a figure, doubtless a woman, is
holding on to a bull’s head, while a man has fallen on his head beside
the animal, both man and woman being dressed in the Cretan fashion.
A third bull rushes furiously by to the right. Most commentators
have seen bull-hunting scenes on both these cups. Thus, on the first
cup were represented three scenes in the drama of trapping a bull by
means of a tame decoy cow; to the right the bull is starting to go to the
rendezvous, while in the center the bull stands by the cow’s side and to
the left he is finally trapped and tied.<a id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> On the other cup the furious
animal at the left was supposed to have thrown one hunter and to have
caught another on its horns. But Mosso’s interpretation of this design
seems to be the right one.<a id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> The two persons struggling with the bull<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
have no lasso and so can hardly be hunters; besides, if the bull had impaled
a hunter with its horns, the hunter would have been represented
with his head up and not down. The figure is, however, uninjured and
holds on with its knee bent over one horn and its shoulder against the
other; it is merely, therefore, intended for a woman acrobat. The net
shown in the centre was never used for hunting wild bulls; more probably
it was intended as an obstacle in racing. The fallen man has been
standing on the netted bull, which, with the gymnast on its back, was
expected to have leaped over the net, but has not succeeded; consequently,
the acrobat has been tumbled over the bull’s head.</p>

<p>This ancient Cretan sport seems to have been similar to that known
in Thessaly and elsewhere in historical days as τὰ ταυροκαθάψια.<a id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> A
survival of it still persists to our day in certain parts of Italy, as, <i>e. g.</i>,
in the province of Viterbo.<a id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>Acrobatic feats of various sorts were attractive to the later Greeks
from the time of Homer down. We have already mentioned one
passage from the Iliad in which a driver of four horses leaps from horse
to horse in motion. On the shield of Achilles tumblers appeared among
the dancers on the dancing-place.<a id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> Patroklos ironically remarks over
the body of Kebriones, as the charioteer falls headlong like a diver
from his chariot when hit by a missile, that there are tumblers
also among the Trojans.<a id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> In later centuries the Athenians evinced a
great attraction to acrobatic feats. The story told of Hippokleides<a id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
reveals that high-born Athenians did not disdain to practice them.
They appear to have formed a sort of side-show attraction at the
Panathenaic festival, as such scenes occur frequently on Attic vases.
Thus on an early (imitation?) Panathenaic vase from Kameiros in the
Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris,<a id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> there is represented behind the driver
a man standing on the back of a horse, armed with a helmet and two
shields, while in front another appears to be balancing himself on a pole.</p>

<p>But such acrobatic scenes as those of Crete and later Greece can
not properly be classed as athletic. They betoken more the love of
excitement than of true sport. The only form of real athletics represented
on Minoan monuments, one which was classed in later Greece as
one of the national sports, was that of boxing, which seems to have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
the favorite gymnastic contest of the Cretans, as it always was of the
later Greeks. Boxing scenes appear on seals,<a id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> on a steatite fragment
of a pyxis found in 1901 at Knossos and, in conjunction with a bull-grappling
<span class="figright200"><a id="f1"></a><img src="images/i_p006.jpg" width="200" height="370" alt="Boxer Vase" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>—So-called <i>Boxer Vase</i>,
from Hagia Triada (Cast). Museum of Candia.</span></span>
scene, on the so-called <i>Boxer
Vase</i> found by the Italians at Hagia Triada
(Fig. <a href="#f1">1</a>). The vase is a cone-shaped
rhyton of steatite, 18 inches high, originally
overlaid with gold foil. It belongs
to the best period of Cretan art, late
Minoan I.<a id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> This vase alone, if no other
monumental evidence were at hand, would
suffice to show the physical prowess and
love of sport of the Minoans. Because
of its scenes of boxing and bull-grappling
Mosso calls it “the most complete monument
that we have of gymnastic exercise
in the Mediterranean civilization.”<a id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> The
later Greek tradition of the high degree
of physical development attained by the
Cretans is proved by this monument.<a id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>The reliefs are arranged in four horizontal
zones.<a id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> One of these, the second from
the top, represents a bull-grappling scene,
showing two racing bulls, upon the head
and horns of one of which a gymnast has
vaulted (not being tossed and helpless,
as most interpreters think).<a id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> The other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
three represent boxers in all attitudes of the prize-ring, hitting,
guarding, falling, and even kicking, as in the later Greek pankration.
Some are victorious, the left arm being extended on guard and the
right drawn back to strike; one (in the top zone) is ready to spring,
just as Hector was ready to spring on Achilles;<a id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> others are prostrate
on the ground with their feet in the air. The violence of the action
recalls the boast of Epeios in the famous match in the Iliad that he
will break his adversary’s bones.<a id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>The method of attack by the right arm and defense by the left is
the same as that formerly used by English pugilists. In the topmost
zone the combatants wear helmets with visors, cheek-pieces, and horse-hair
plumes, and also shoes; in the third zone down the pugilists also
wear helmets, though of a different pattern, while the bottom zone
shows figures, perhaps youths, with bare heads. Some of the boxers
appear to wear boxing-gloves. In the lowest zone we see the well-known
feat of swinging the antagonist up by the legs and throwing him—if
we may so conclude from the contorted position of the vanquished,
whose legs are in the air.</p>

<p>A similar figure appears in relief on the fragment of a pyxis found at
Knossos.<a id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> A youth with clenched fists stands with left arm extended
as if to ward off a blow, while his right arm is drawn back and rests on
his hip; below we see the bent knee of a prostrate figure, evidently that
of his vanquished opponent. The boxer has a wasp-like waist and
wears a metal girdle. His left leg is well modeled, the muscles not
being exaggerated.</p>

<h3>ATHLETICS IN HOMER.</h3>

<p>We have evidence, therefore, that the love of sport existed in Crete as
it has existed in all countries since. But the comparatively unathletic
character of the Aegean culture is shown by the complete absence of
athletic representations—apart from bull-grappling scenes—in the art
of its last phase at Mycenæ and Tiryns on the mainland. This is an
independent argument for the view that the civilization of the mainland
was chiefly the product of the old Mediterranean stock, which
was finally conquered by the invading Achæans, who are represented
in Homer as skilled gymnasts. In Homer we are immediately conscious
of being in another world, for here we are in an atmosphere of
true athletics, which are fully developed and quite secular in character.<a id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>
They are, however, wholly spontaneous, for there are as yet
neither meets nor organized training, neither stadia, gymnasia, nor
palæstræ; for such an organization of athletics did not exist until the
sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> But Homer’s account of the funeral games of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Patroklos is pervaded by a spirit of true athletics and has a perennial
attraction for every lover of sport. Walter Leaf says of the chariot-race,
which is the culminating feature of the description, that it is “a
piece of narrative as truthful in its characters as it is dramatic and
masterly in description.”<a id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> Such a description could have been composed
only by a poet who belonged to a people long acquainted with
athletics and intensely interested in them. Nestor often speaks of a
remoter past, when the gods and heroes contended. Odysseus says he
could not have fought with Herakles nor Eurytos, heroes of the olden
time, “who contended with the immortal gods.” The Homeric warrior
was distinguished from the merchant by his knowledge of sport. Thus
Euryalos of the Phaiakians says in no complimentary tone to Odysseus:
“No truly, stranger, nor do I think thee at all like one that is skilled
in games ... rather art thou such an one as comes and goes in a
benched ship, a master of sailors that are merchantmen, one with a
memory for his freight, or that hath charge of a cargo homeward bound,
and of greedily gotten gains.”<a id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> It is beside the point whether the
chief passages in the poems which relate to sports are late in origin or
not, even if they are later than 776 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, the traditional first Olympiad.
In any case the later poet merely followed an older tradition. At the
funeral games of Patroklos all the events are practical in character,
the natural amusements of men chiefly interested in war. They are,
however, not merely military, but are truly athletic. The oldest and
most aristocratic of all the events described is the chariot-race—in which
the war-chariot is used—the monopoly of the nobles then, as it was
always later the sport of kings and the rich.<a id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> Boxing and wrestling
come next in importance, already occupying the position of preëminence
which they hold in the poems of Pindar. The foot-race between
Ajax, the son of Oileus, and Odysseus follows. Of the last four events,
three—the single combat between Ajax and Diomedes, the throwing of
the <i>solos</i>, and the contest in archery—are admitted to be late additions.
The last event of all, the casting of the spear, may be earlier, but we
know little about it, as the contest did not take place, Achilles yielding
the first prize to Agamemnon. Most of these later events are described
in a lifeless manner and have not the vim and compelling interest of
the earlier ones. Indeed the contest in archery seems to be treated
with a certain amount of ridicule, which shows the contempt of the
great nobles for so plebeian a sport. The armed contest, though it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
pictured in art certainly as early as the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>,<a id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> never had a
place in the later Greek games.<a id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> Jumping, an important part of the
later pentathlon, is mentioned but once in the poems, as a feature of
the sports of the Phaiakians. But the later pentathlon, as Gardiner
says, is certainly not suggested in Homer’s account, though many
have assumed it,<a id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> merely because Nestor mentions his former contests
at Bouprasion in boxing, in running, in hurling the spear, and in the
chariot-race.<a id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> This, however, is not the combination of contests
known much later as the pentathlon, in which the same contestants
had to compete in the series of events—running, jumping, wrestling,
diskos-throwing, and javelin-throwing.</p>

<h3>ORIGIN OF GREEK GAMES IN THE CULT OF THE DEAD.</h3>

<p>In these games described in the Iliad we see an example of the origin
of the later athletic festivals in the cult of the dead. Homer knows
only of funeral games<a id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> and there is no trace in the poems of the later
athletic meetings held in honor of a god.<a id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> However, the association
of the later games with religious festivals held at stated times can be
traced to the games with which the funeral of the Homeric chief was
celebrated. The oldest example of periodic funeral games in Greece
of which we have knowledge were those held in Arkadia in honor of the
dead Azan, the father of Kleitor and son of Arkas, at which prizes were
offered at least for horse-racing.<a id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>Though the origin of the four national religious festivals in Greece—at
Olympia, Delphi, Nemea, and on the Isthmus—is buried in a mass
of conflicting legend, certain writers agree in saying that all of them
were founded on funeral games, though they were later dedicated to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
gods.<a id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> Thus the Isthmian were instituted in honor of the dead Melikertes,<a id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
the Nemean in honor of Opheltes or Archemoros,<a id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> the Pythian
in honor of the slain Python,<a id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> the Olympian in honor of the hero Pelops.<a id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
To both Pindar and Bacchylides the Olympian games were associated
with the tomb of Pelops; Pausanias, on the other hand, records that the
ancient Elean writers ascribed their origin to the Idæan Herakles of
Crete.<a id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> It was a common tradition that Herakles founded the games,
some writers saying that it was the Cretan, others that it was the
Greek hero, the son of Zeus and Alkmena.<a id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>Despite the variation in legends relative to the institution of the
four national games, we should not doubt the universal tradition that
all were funerary in origin. The tradition is confirmed by many lines
of argument: by the survival of funeral customs in their later rituals,
by the later custom of instituting funeral games in honor of dead
warriors both in antiquity and in modern times, and by the testimony
of early athletic art in Greece.<a id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> We shall now briefly consider
these arguments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<p>As an example of the survival of funeral customs in later ritual,
Pausanias says that the annual officers at Olympia, even in his day, sacrificed
a black ram to Pelops.<a id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> The fact that a black victim was offered
over a trench instead of on an altar proves that Pelops was still worshipped
as a hero and not as a god. The scholiast on Pindar, <i>Ol.</i>, I,
146, says that all Peloponnesian lads each year lashed themselves on
the grave of Pelops until the blood ran down their backs as a libation
to the hero. Furthermore, all the contestants at Olympia sacrificed
first to Pelops and then to Zeus.<a id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>Funeral games were held in honor of departed warriors and eminent
men all over the Greek world and at all periods, from the legendary
games of Patroklos and Pelias and others to those celebrated at Thessalonika
in Valerian’s time.<a id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> Thus Miltiades was honored by games
on the Thracian Chersonesus,<a id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> Leonidas and Pausanias at Sparta,<a id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>
Brasidas at Amphipolis,<a id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> Timoleon at Syracuse,<a id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> and Mausolos at
Halikarnassos.<a id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> Alexander instituted games in honor of the dead
Hephaistion<a id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> and the conqueror himself was honored in a similar way.<a id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>
The <i>Eleutheria</i> were celebrated at Platæa at stated times in honor
of the soldiers who fell there against the Medes in 479 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>,<a id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> and in
the Academy a festival was held under the direction of the polemarch
in honor of the Athenian soldiers who had died for their country and
were buried in the Kerameikos.<a id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> Funeral games were also common
in Italy. We find athletic scenes decorating Etruscan tombs—including
boxing, wrestling, horse-racing, and chariot-racing.<a id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> The Romans
borrowed their funeral games from Etruria as well as their gladiatorial
shows, which were doubtless also funerary in origin.<a id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> Frazer cites
examples of the custom of instituting games in honor of dead warriors
among many modern peoples, Circassians, Chewsurs of the Caucasus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Siamese, Kirghiz, in India, and among the North American Indian
tribes. Gardiner notes the Irish fairs in honor of a departed chief,
which existed from pagan days down to the last century.<a id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<p>The testimony of early Greek athletic art also points to the same
funerary origin of the games. The funeral games of Pelias and those
held by Akastos in honor of his father were depicted respectively on the
two most famous monuments of early Greek decorative art, on the chest
of Kypselos dedicated in the Heraion at Olympia and on the throne of
Apollo at Amyklai in Lakonia, the latter being the work of the Ionian
sculptor Bathykles. Though both these works are lost, the description
of one of them at least, that of the chest, by Pausanias,<a id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> is so detailed
and precise that the scenes represented upon it have been paralleled figure
for figure on early Ionian (especially Chalkidian) and Corinthian
vases, contemporary or later, and on Corinthian and Argive decorative
bronze reliefs. Many attempts have been made, therefore, to restore
the chest, and as more monuments become known, which throw
light on the composition and types, these attempts are constantly growing
in certainty, even though conjecture may continue to enter in.<a id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>The figures were wrought in relief, partly in ivory and gold and partly
in the cedar wood itself, deployed on its surface in a series of bands,
such as we commonly see on early vases. This use of gold and ivory
is the first example in Greek art of the custom employed by Pheidias
and other sculptors of the great age of Greek sculpture. We have
already noted its use in the ivory acrobats from Crete, which were
made, perhaps, a thousand years before the chest.<a id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> Out of the thirty-three
scenes depicted on its surface all but two or three were mythological,
and among these were scenes from the funeral games of Pelias,
including a two-horse chariot-race (P., §9), a boxing and wrestling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
match (§10), a foot-race, quoit-throwing, and a victor represented as
being crowned (§10), and prize tripods (§11).</p>

<p>The most valuable parallel to some of the scenes described by
Pausanias is found on the Amphiaraos vase in Berlin,<a id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> dating from
the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, on which the wrestling match and chariot-race
correspond surprisingly well with the descriptions of Pausanias,
despite certain differences in detail. Another archaic vase depicts a
two-horse chariot-race and the parting of Amphiaraos and Eriphyle.<a id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>
The scenes on this latter vase appear to have been copied from those
on the chest, and it is possible that the scenes on the Berlin vase had
the same origin.</p>

<p>Funeral games are commonly pictured on early vases. Thus on a
proto-Attic amphora, discovered by the British School of Athens in
excavating the Gymnasion of Kynosarges, there are groups of wrestlers
and chariot-racers. The wrestling bout here, however, seems to be to
the death, as the victor has his adversary by the throat with both
hands. It may be a mythological scene, perhaps representing the bout
between Herakles and Antaios. A still earlier representation of funeral
games is shown by a Dipylon geometric vase from the Akropolis now in
Copenhagen, dating back possibly to the eighth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> On one
side two nude men, who have grasped each other by the arms, are
ready to stab one another with swords. This may represent, however,
as Gardiner suggests, only a mimic contest. On the other side are two
boxers standing between groups of warriors and dancers. A similar
scene in repoussé appears on a Cypriote silver vase from Etruria now in
the Uffizi in Florence.<a id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> We should also, in this connection, note again
the reliefs representing funeral games, which appear on the sixth-century
sarcophagus from Klazomenai already mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> Here is
represented a combat of armed men; amid chariots stand groups of
men armed with helmets, shields, and spears, while flute-players stand
between them; at either end is a pillar with a prize vase upon it; against
one leans a naked man with a staff, doubtless intended to represent the
spirit of the deceased in whose honor the games are being held.</p>

<p>Games in honor of the dead tended to become periodic. The tomb
of the honored warriors became a rallying-point for neighboring people,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
who would convene to see the games. While some of these games
were destined never to transcend local importance, others developed
into the Panhellenic festivals. As the worship of ancestors became
metamorphosed into that of heroes, the games became part of hero
cults, which antedated those of the Olympian gods. But as the gods
gradually superseded the heroes in the popular religion, they usurped
the sanctuaries and the games held there, which had long been a part of
the earlier worship. We are not here concerned, however, with the
difficult question of the origin of funeral games. They may have taken
the place of earlier human sacrifices, which would explain the armed
fight at the games of Patroklos and its appearance on archaic vases
and sarcophagi; or they may have commemorated early contests of succession,
which would explain many mythical contests like the chariot-race
between Pelops and Oinomaos for Hippodameia, or the wrestling
match between Zeus and Kronos. In any case such games would
never have attained the importance which they did attain in Greece,
if it had not been for the athletic spirit and love of competition so characteristic
of the Hellenic race. Whatever their origin, therefore, there
is little doubt that out of them developed the great games of historic
Greece. The constant relationship between Greek religion and Greek
athletics can be explained in no other way.<a id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<h3>EARLY HISTORY OF THE FOUR NATIONAL GAMES.</h3>

<p>By the beginning of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> the athletic spirit displayed
in the Homeric poems had given rise to the four national festivals—at
Olympia, Delphi, Nemea, and on the Isthmus. On these four,
many lesser games were modeled.<a id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> The origin of all these, as we have
already remarked, is lost in a mass of legend. The myths of the origin
of Olympia are particularly conflicting. We are practically certain,
however, that Olympia as a sanctuary preceded the advent of the
Achæans into the Peloponnesus, and that the foundation of the games
preceded the coming of the Dorians, but was probably later than that
of the Achæans. The importance of the games dates from the time
after the Dorian invasion of the Peloponnesus, when the warring
peoples finally became pacified.<a id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> For centuries Olympia was over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>shadowed
by Delphi and the Ionian festival on Delos. The importance
of the latter festival in the eighth and seventh centuries <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> is
shown by the Homeric Hymn to the Delian Apollo. Only by the beginning
of the seventh century had Olympia begun to gain its prestige.
The pre-Dorian Pisatai, in whose territory the sanctuary was situated,
probably controlled it early. The Dorian allies, the Eleans, whom legend had
King Oxylos lead into the Peloponnesus from Aitolia,<a id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> tried to wrest
this control from the Pisatai, who, however, aided by religious reverence
for the sanctuary, were able to maintain their rights. On account
of the conflict the games languished, until finally a truce was made by
the two factions and the games were re-established under their common
management. This work was ascribed to Iphitos and Kleosthenes,
kings respectively of Elis and Pisa, and to Lykourgos of Sparta.<a id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
The dual control was not successful, as the jealous Pisatai constantly
tried to regain their old honor; but the Eleans, supported by the
Spartans, prevailed and finally, after the Persian wars, destroyed Pisa
and the other revolting cities of Triphylia and henceforth remained
in sole control. The restoration of the games under Iphitos and his
colleagues took place in 776 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, from which date the festival was
celebrated every fourth year, until it was finally abolished by the
Roman emperor Theodosius at the end of the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span> In
776 Koroibos of Elis won the foot-race and this was the first dated Olympiad
in the Olympian register,<a id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> and from it, as Pausanias says,<a id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> the
unbroken tradition of the Olympiads began. This history of Olympia
is very different from the orthodox mythical story told by Pausanias
and Strabo and based on the “ancient writings of the Eleans.”<a id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> According
to it the games were originally instituted by the Eleans under
Oxylos and refounded by Iphitos, his descendant, together with
Lykourgos, still under the management of the Eleans. In Ol. 8 the
Pisatans invoked the aid of the Argive king Pheidon and dispossessed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
the Eleans, but they lost the control of Olympia in the next Olympiad.
In Ol. 28 Elis, during a war with Dyme, allowed the Pisatans
to celebrate the games. Six Olympiads later the king of Pisa came to
Olympia with an army and took charge. The story leaves the Pisatans
in control from about Olympiads 30 to 51, but some time between
Ols. 48 and 52 the Eleans defeated Pisa and destroyed it, and henceforth
controlled the games. Such a story was manifestly a contrivance by
the later priests of Elis to justify their control of the games through a
prior claim. It is contradicted by all the evidence.<a id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> The antiquity
of Olympia is known to us from the results of excavations and from its
religious history. The latest excavations on the site have disclosed the
remains of six prehistoric buildings with apsidal endings, below the
geometric stratum, upon the site of what used to be considered the
remnants of the great altar of Zeus.<a id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> Such an inference is borne out
by many primitive features in the religious history of the sanctuary.
The altar of Kronos on the hill to the north of the Altis was earlier
than that of Zeus; an earth altar antedated that of Zeus, while a survival
of the earlier worship of the powers of the underworld is seen in
the custom, lasting through later centuries, of allowing only one woman,
the priestess of Demeter Chamyne, to witness the games. We also
know that the worship of the Pelasgian Hera antedated that of the
Hellenic Zeus; her temple, the Heraion, is the most ancient of which
the foundations still stand, a temple built of stone, wood, and sun-dried
bricks, whose origin is to be referred to the tenth, if not to the eleventh,
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> We have already remarked that the worship of the hero
Pelops preceded that of the god Zeus.<a id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> All such indications attest the
high antiquity of Olympia. That it is not mentioned in Homer, while
Delphi and Dodona are, only proves that in the poet’s time it was still
merely a local shrine. Not until the beginning of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>
did it attain the distinction, which it retained ever afterwards, of being
the foremost national festival of Hellas.<a id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p>

<p>The periodical celebration of the three other national festivals
was not dated—except in legend—before the early years of the sixth
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, though local festivals must have existed also on these
sites long before.<a id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> The old music festival at Delphi, which finally was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
held every eight years,<a id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> was changed in 586 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, in consequence of the
Sacred War,<a id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> into a Panhellenic festival celebrated thereafter every
four years (<i>pentaëteris</i>). It was under the presidency of the Amphiktyonic
League, which introduced athletic and equestrian events copied
from those at Olympia<a id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> and replaced the older money prizes with the
simple bay wreath. About the same time the Nemean and Isthmian
games were instituted. The local games at Nemea, said to have been
founded by Adrastos in honor of a child, were reorganized some time
before 573 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, the first Nemead.<a id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> Thereafter they were celebrated
every two years, in the second and fourth of the corresponding Olympiads.<a id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>
They were administered in honor of Zeus by the small town
of Kleonai under Argive influence. The games were transferred to
Argos some time between 460 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> and the close of the third century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> Centuries later, Hadrian revived the prestige of the games at
Argos. The games held on the Isthmus also originated as an old local
festival, which was revived in 586 or 582 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> We are not sure whether
they were refounded in Poseidon’s honor by Periandros or after the
death of Psammetichos in commemoration of the ending of the tyranny
at Corinth. The geographical location of Corinth, the meeting-place of
East and West, involved it in many wars, and therefore the Isthmian
games never attained the prestige of the other national festivals; they
were held every two years in the spring of the second and fourth years
of the corresponding Olympiads and were administered by Corinth.<a id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<p>Besides the four national games, many Greek cities had purely local
ones, some of which originated in prehistoric days in honor of hero
cults, while others were founded at historical dates. Athens was
particularly favored in having many such local festivals. The most
important of these were the <i>Panathenaic</i> games in honor of Athena,
which developed from earlier annual <i>Athenaia</i> or <i>Panathenaia</i>. The
festival was remodeled, or perhaps founded, just before Peisistratos
seized the tyranny (561–560 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), possibly by Solon, who died 560–559
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> The name certainly points to the unity of Athens promoted by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Solon, if not to the earlier unification of the village communities of
Attika ascribed to Theseus. In any case, under Peisistratos it became
something more than a local festival, as the recitation of Homer
became a feature of it. Following the games at Delphi and Olympia,
the <i>Great Panathenaia</i> were held every four years (the third year of
each Olympiad) in the month of Hekatombaion (July), while the more
ancient annual festival continued yearly under the name of the <i>Little
Panathenaia</i>. There were musical, literary, and athletic contests.
The central feature of the festival was the procession which ascended
from the lower city to the Parthenon on the Akropolis to offer the
goddess a robe woven by noble Athenian maidens and matrons.<a id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> This
procession is known to us in detail from the great Parthenon frieze.
The <i>Theseia</i> exemplify a festival whose origin can be definitely dated.
Kimon, the son of the hero of Marathon, in 469 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, discovered the
supposed bones of the national hero Theseus on the island of Skyros.
The Delphic oracle counseled the Athenians to place them in an honorable
resting-place. Perhaps there was a legend that the hero was
buried on Skyros; in any case a grave was found there which contained
the corpse of a warrior of great size, and this was brought back
to Athens as the actual remains of Theseus. Thereafter an annual festival
was celebrated by the Athenian <i>epheboi</i>, comprising military contests
and athletic events—stade, dolichos, and diaulos running races,
wrestling, boxing, pankration, hoplite running, etc. It began on the
sixth of Pyanepsion (October), and was followed by the <i>Epitaphia</i>, a
funeral festival in honor of national heroes and youths who had fallen
fighting for Athens.<a id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> Athletic games were held at the <i>Herakleia</i> in
honor of Herakles at Marathon in the month of Metageitnion, and had
attained great popularity by the time of Pindar.<a id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> The <i>Eleusinia</i>, in
honor of Demeter, took place annually in Athens in the month of
Boëdromion, when horse-races and musical and other contests were
held. This Attic festival claimed a greater antiquity even than
Olympia. The great national festivals encouraged these smaller
local ones, so that they attracted competitors from the whole Greek
world.</p>

<h3>EARLY PRIZES FOR ATHLETES.</h3>

<p>The prizes which were offered at the early games in Greece were
uniformly articles of value. Their value, however, was regarded not
so much in the light of rewards to the victors as proofs of the generous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
spirit of the holders of the games, who thereby celebrated the dead in
whose honor the contest was held. In Homer’s account of the funeral
games of Patroklos, each contestant, whether victorious or not, received
a prize. In one case a prize was given where the contest was
not held. In the chariot-race five prizes were offered: for the winner a
slave girl and a tripod; for the second best a six-year-old mare in foal;
for the third a cauldron; for the fourth two talents of gold; and for the
last a two-handled cup.<a id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> For the wrestling match the winner received
a tripod worth twelve oxen, while the vanquished received a skilled
slave woman worth four oxen.<a id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> For the boxing match a mule was the
first prize and a two-handled cup the second.<a id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> For the foot-race a
silver bowl of Sidonian make, an ox, and half a talent of gold were
the prizes.<a id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></p>

<p>Hesiod records his winning a tripod for a victory gained in singing
at the games of Amphidamas at Chalkis.<a id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> Tripods were the commonest
prizes at all early games and it was not till later that they became

became a part of the Apolline cult and the special attribute of that
god.<a id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> Gold and silver vessels and articles of bronze were everywhere
used as prizes. In early days bronze was very valuable. Pindar proves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
this for games held in Achaia and Arkadia;<a id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> and it continued to be used
in later times, as, <i>e. g.</i>, at the <i>Panathenaia</i>, where a hydria of bronze
was a prize in the torch-race.<a id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> At the lesser games all sorts of articles
were offered, merely for their value. Thus a shield was offered at the
Argive <i>Heraia</i>,<a id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> a bowl at the games in honor of Aiakos on Aegina,<a id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> silver

games there in honor of Onomastos, is in the British Museum,<a id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> while
measures of barley and corn were prizes at the <i>Eleusinia</i>.<a id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> While
presents of value continued to be given at the local games,<a id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> a simple
wreath of leaves gradually came to be the prize offered the victor at the
great national festivals. Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> says that this was composed of wild
olive (κότινος) at Olympia, of laurel (δάφνη) at Delphi, of pine (πίτυς)
at the Isthmus, and of celery (σέλινον) at Nemea. Phlegon says that the
olive wreath was first used by Iphitos in Ol. 7 (&#8239;=&#8239;752 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), when it was
given to the Messenian runner Daïkles,<a id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> and that for the preceding
Olympiads there was no crown.<a id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> Probably before that date tripods
and other articles of value were the prizes at Olympia, as we know they
were elsewhere. Pausanias says that the wild olive came from the land
of the Hyperboreans.<a id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> Pindar calls it merely olive (ἐλαία), and not
wild olive.<a id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> The Athenian tradition was that the olive which Herakles
planted at Olympia was a shoot of a sacred tree which grew on the
banks of the Ilissos in Attica.<a id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> Phlegon also says that the first crown
came from Attika. In later days the Olympic wreaths were cut from
the “Olive of the Faircrown”;<a id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> its branches were cut with a golden
sickle by a boy whose parents must be living;<a id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> it grew at Olympia in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
spot near the so-called Pantheion,<a id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> which was probably a grove behind
the temple of Zeus.<a id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> The laurel prize at the Pythian games replaced
the older articles of value or money in 582 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> It came from Tempe
and was plucked by a boy whose parents must be living.<a id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> The wreath is
seen on late Delphian coins of the imperial age.<a id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> Lucian also states that
apples were given as prizes at Delphi.<a id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> Wild celery was the prize at
the Isthmus in the time of Pindar.<a id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> It was dried or withered to
differentiate it from the fresh celery used at Nemea.<a id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> Later writers say
that the wreath was of the leaves of the pine,<a id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> which was the tree sacred
to Poseidon. Probably pine leaves composed the older wreath, a practice
certainly revived again in later Roman imperial days;<a id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> for while
on coins of Augustus and Nero celery is represented, those of Antoninus

the approach to Poseidon’s sanctuary.<a id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> The prize at Nemea was celery
and not parsley, as many wrongly interpret the wreath appearing on
Selinuntian coins.<a id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> Pausanias also states that at most Greek games a
palm wreath was placed in the victor’s right hand.<a id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> The palm as a

<h3>DEDICATION OF ATHLETE PRIZES.</h3>

<p>Just as soldiers on returning from successful campaigns might dedicate
their spoils of victory, victors in athletic contests might consecrate
to the gods their prizes. In the Homeric poems we have no certain
evidence of such a custom. A Delphic tripod was ascribed to Diomedes
and possibly this was a prize won at the funeral games in honor
of Patroklos.<a id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> The first literary example of such a dedication of which
we are certain is the prize tripod dedicated to the Helikonian Muses by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
Hesiod.<a id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> Frequently such dedications were tripods; thus a Pythian
tripod was dedicated to Herakles at Thebes by the Arkadian musician
Echembrotos in 586 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>;<a id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> a tripod was dedicated in the sixth century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> or perhaps earlier at Athens for some acrobatic or juggling trick;<a id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a>
a victorious boxer dedicated one at Thebes.<a id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> It became customary by
the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> for victors at the <i>Triopia</i> to offer prize tripods to
Apollo.<a id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> Tripods or fragments of them have been found at Olympia<a id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a>
and elsewhere. Many other objects were also offered.<a id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> Sometimes
a victor would dedicate the object by which he won his victory instead
of his prize, just as a soldier might dedicate his arms instead of
his spoils of war. Certain types of victors, <i>e. g.</i>, those especially in
running, the race in armor, singing, etc., would be excluded from
making such dedications owing to the nature of the contest. Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a>
tells us, for instance, that twenty-five bronze shields were kept
in the temple of Zeus at Olympia for the use of hoplite runners, which
shows that these runners did not use all at least of their own armor.
In some cases diskoi were lent to pentathletes. Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> says that
three quoits were kept in the treasury of the Sikyonians at Olympia
for use in the pentathlon. There are, however, as we shall see,
instances of quoits being dedicated by victors. The pentathlete
might consecrate either his diskos, javelin, or jumping-weights.<a id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> Perhaps
the huge red-sandstone block of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, weighing
315 pounds and inscribed with the name and feat of Bybon, may have
been such an <i>ex voto</i>,<a id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> since Pausanias says the contestants at Olympia
originally used stones for quoits.<a id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> A stone, weighing 480 kilograms
(about 1,056 pounds), was found on Thera, inscribed “Eumastos raised
me from the ground.”<a id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> Poplios (Publius) Asklepiades, who won the
pentathlon at Olympia in the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span>,<a id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> dedicated a bronze
diskos to Zeus, showing the old custom was kept up till late. Many
bronze diskoi have been found in the excavations of the Altis.<a id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> We
have instances of the dedication of jumping-weights (ἁλτῆρες).<a id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a>
Examples of dedicated strigils have been found at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> Torches
were dedicated at Athens.<a id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> Actors dedicated their masks,<a id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
some of the ivory lyres and plectra conserved in the Parthenon were
probably offerings of musical victors at the Panathenaic games.<a id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a>
Equestrian victors dedicated their chariots, or models of them, and
their horses. These models might be large or small. We have notices
of large chariot-groups at Olympia of Kleosthenes,<a id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> Gelo,<a id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> and Hiero
of Syracuse;<a id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> of small ones of Euagoras,<a id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> Glaukon,<a id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> Kyniska,<a id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> and
Polypeithes.<a id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> A large number of miniature models of chariots and
horses in bronze and terra cotta have been found at Olympia,<a id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> some of
which have no wheels. Many very thin foil wheels have also been
found.<a id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> Furtwaengler<a id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> believes that these wheels are conventional
reductions of whole chariots. Some of them are cast<a id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> and they are
generally four-spoked, but two mule-car wheels are five-spoked.<a id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a>
These various models are so common and of so little value, however,
that they may have had nothing to do with chariot-races.<a id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></p>

<p>Many great artists, <i>e. g.</i>, Kalamis,<a id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> Euphranor,<a id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> and Lysippos,<a id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> are
known to have made chariot-groups and it is reasonable to assume that
some of these were votive in character. Besides dedications of chariot
victors, we find at Olympia also those of horse-racers. These were similarly
both large and small, with and without jockeys. Thus jockeys on
horseback by Kalamis stood on either side of Hiero’s chariot.<a id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> Krokon
of Eretria, who won the horse-race at the end of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>,<a id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a>
dedicated a small bronze horse at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> The monument of the
sons of Pheidolas of Corinth,<a id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> representing a horse on the top of a column,
must have been small. Pausanias, in mentioning the two statues<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
of the Spartan chariot victor Lykinos by Myron,<a id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> says that one of
the horses which the victor brought to Olympia was not allowed to
enter the foal-race, and therefore was entered in the horse-race. This
story was probably told Pausanias by the Olympia guides and may
have arisen from the smallness of one of the horses in the monument.<a id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a>
The sculptors Kalamis,<a id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> Kanachos,<a id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> and Hegias<a id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> are known to have
made groups representing horse-victors, and Pliny derives the whole
<i>genre</i> of equestrian monuments from the Greeks.<a id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> Great numbers of
small figures of horses and riders have been excavated at Olympia<a id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a>
and elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> Equestrian groups of various kinds were also known
outside Olympia. Thus Arkesilas IV of Kyrene offered a chariot model
at Delphi for a victory in 466 <span class="smcap">B. C</span>;<a id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> the base found on the Akropolis
of Athens and inscribed with the name Onatas probably upheld such
a group;<a id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> the equestrian statue of Isokrates on the Akropolis was
also probably a dedication for a victory in horse-racing.<a id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></p>

<h3>DEDICATION OF STATUES AT OLYMPIA AND ELSEWHERE.</h3>

<p>Not only did equestrian contests and the pentathlon give the victor
an opportunity to represent the means by which he gained his prize,
but any victorious athlete could set up a statue of himself in his own
honor, which might either represent him in the characteristic attitude
of his contest (perhaps with its distinguishing attributes) or might be a
simple monument showing neither action nor attribute. This brings
us to the main subject of the present work—the discussion of the
different types of victor statues at Olympia.</p>

<p>Of all the national games of Hellas, our knowledge of Olympia is
fullest, both because of the detailed account of its monuments by
Pausanias, who visited Elis in 173 or 174 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span>, and because of the systematic
excavation of the Altis by the German government in the seventies
of the last century. We shall not be concerned, except incidentally,
with monuments set up at the other national games, which are known
to us in no such degree as those of Olympia. The interest of Pausanias
in Delphi was almost entirely of a religious nature, and the lesser
renown of both Nemea and the Isthmus caused him to treat their topography
and monuments in a most summary manner. Though the <i>Pythia</i>
as a festival were second only to the <i>Olympia</i>, as an athletic meet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
they scarcely equalled the <i>Nemea</i> or the <i>Isthmia</i>. From the earliest days
music was the chief competition at Delphi; the oldest and most important
event in the musical programme there all through Greek history was
the Hymn to Apollo, sung with the accompaniment of the lyre, in which
was celebrated the victory of the god over the Python. By 582 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> singing
to the flute (αὐλῳδία) was also added, but was almost immediately
discontinued. In the same year a flute solo was also inaugurated.<a id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a>
In 558 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> lyre-playing was introduced. Under the Roman Empire
poetic and dramatic competitions were prominent, but the date of
their introduction is not known. Pliny mentions contests in painting.<a id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a>
After music the equestrian contests were the most important,
even rivalling those of Olympia. By 586 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, as we have seen, athletic
events were inaugurated. The athletic importance of the games on
the Isthmus was inferior to that of Olympia and its religious character
to that of Delphi, though these games were the most frequented of all
the great national ones, because of the accessibility of the place and
its nearness to Corinth.<a id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> The inferiority of the athletics here may be
judged by the fact that Solon assigned only 100 drachmæ to an Isthmian
victor, while 500 were given to one from Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> We have
little knowledge of these games through the great period of Greek
history, only a reference here and there to a victor.<a id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> We know much
more of them under the Romans, when the prosperity of Corinth was
revived; at that time, however, there was little true interest in athletics.
Corinth then spent great sums in procuring wild animals for the arena.<a id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a>
Excavations have added little to our knowledge of these games.<a id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> The
interest at Nemea in athletics was second only to that of Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a>
While music was the most important feature at Delphi, and the Isthmian
games were attended chiefly for the attractions of the neighboring
Corinth, there was nothing but the games themselves to attract people
to the retired valley of Nemea. Athletic contests were the only
feature here until late times and great attention was paid to those of
boys.<a id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> The records of the victors at these games are very scanty.<a id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></p>

<p>At all these three games victor monuments were set up, though in
no such profusion as at Olympia.</p>

<p>Of those set up at Delphi, Pausanias shows his disdain by these
words: “As to the athletes and musical competitors who have attracted
no notice from the majority of mankind, I hold them hardly worthy
of attention; and the athletes who have made themselves a name have
already been set forth by me in my account of Elis.”<a id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> He mentions
the statue of only one victor, that of Phaÿllos, who won at Delphi twice
in the pentathlon and once in running. A score or more of inscriptions
in honor of these men whom Pausanias treats so contemptuously have
been recovered. Some of them record offerings dedicated for victories,
though most of them record decrees passed by the Delphians, who voted
the victors not only wreaths of laurel, but seats of honor at the games
and other privileges.<a id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> Victor statues seem to have stood outside the
sacred precinct at Delphi and not within it, as at Olympia, since Pausanias
mentions the sanctuary after mentioning the statue of Phaÿllos.<a id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a>
Other Greek and Roman writers give us stray hints of these statues. Thus,
Pliny mentions a statue at Delphi of a <i>pancratiastes</i> by Pythagoras of
Rhegion<a id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> and says that Myron made <i>Delphicos pentathlos, pancratiastas</i>.<a id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a>
A scholion on Pindar<a id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> mentions the helmeted statue of the hoplite runner
Telisikrates as standing in the precinct. Justin, in speaking of the
Gallic invasion of Delphi, mentions <i>statuasque cum quadrigis, quarum
ingens copia procul visebatur</i>, thus referring to large chariot-groups,
which would be very sightly on the slope of the precinct.<a id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> An idea of
the beauty of such groups may be gathered from the remnant of one,
the bronze <i>Charioteer</i> discovered by the French excavators, which is one
of the most important archaic sculptures from antiquity (Fig. <a href="#f66">66</a>).<a id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></p>

<p>We know from the words of Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> that victor statues also stood
on the Isthmus, and we should assume the same for Nemea, though
in both places they must have been few in number. At the various
local games it was customary for victors to erect statues of themselves.
Thus we know of such dedications at the Bœotian games in Thebes,<a id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a>
at the Didymaion,<a id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> and at the <i>Lykaia</i> in Arkadia.<a id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> Many such
victor statues decorated different localities of Athens. Thus, on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
Akropolis, we know of the statues of the hoplite runner Epicharinos,<a id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a>
of the pancratiast Hermolykos,<a id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> of a helmeted man by the sculptor
Kleoitas,<a id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> of a παῖς κελητίζων representing Isokrates;<a id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> in the Prytaneion,
of the statue of the pancratiast Autolykos.<a id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> Lykourgos, the rhetor, mentions
victor statues in the agora of Athens.<a id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> Some of these Athenian
statues may have been those of Olympic victors;<a id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> and of victors certainly
Olympic we know of the statues of Kallias the pancratiast,<a id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> of
the charioteer Hermokrates,<a id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> and of the bronze mares of Kimon.<a id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> Of
the statues of Nemean victors at Athens we know of that of Hegestratos,
victor in an unknown contest.<a id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> Of Isthmian victors there we know of
that of the pancratiast Diophanes,<a id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> and of other examples.<a id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> We have
inscriptional record of the statues at Athens of a boy victor at the
<i>Panathenaia</i> and the <i>Thargelia</i> in chariot-racing,<a id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> of a victor at the
<i>Pythia</i>, <i>Isthmia</i>, <i>Nemea</i>, and the <i>Panathenaia</i>,<a id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> of one at the <i>Nemea</i>
and <i>Herakleia</i> at Thebes,<a id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> of one at the <i>Eleusinia</i>,<a id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> of one at the
<i>Panathenaia</i> and <i>Dionysia</i>,<a id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> and of others at several games.<a id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a></p>

<p>The erection of a statue in the Altis at Olympia was an honor which
the Elean officers in charge of the games<a id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> gave to victors to glorify
their victory.<a id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> Pliny, in a well-known passage of the <i>Historia Naturalis</i>,<a id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a>
says it was customary for all victors to set up statues, while Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a>
says not all athletes did this, for “some of those who specially
distinguished themselves in the games ... have had no statues.”
This apparent contradiction in the statements of the two writers is to
be explained, as Dittenberger<a id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> and others have pointed out, on the
ground that Pliny states the general privilege extended to the victor,
while Pausanias states its practical working out, since the setting up
of a statue was an undertaking which would be limited by the early
death, poverty, or some other disability of the victorious athlete. The
cost of making, transporting, and setting up a statue was considerable,
and very often a victor must have been too poor to do it. In such a
case he would often be contented to set up merely a statuette or small
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
figure in bronze or marble. Several such bronze figures have been unearthed
at Olympia,<a id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> one of which we reproduce in Fig. <a href="#f2">2</a>, and we have
many examples found outside the Altis: <i>e. g.</i>, a group of wrestlers,<a id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a>

a boxer,<a id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> and the arm of a quoit-thrower<a id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a>
from the Athenian Akropolis,

and the statuette of a παῖς κέλης
from Dodona.<a id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> We should also
mention the great number of statuettes
of diskos-throwers in modern
museums.<a id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> Boy victors especially
would use the less expensive
marble for such statuettes and we
have the remnants of many such
found in the excavations of the
Altis.<a id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> Pausanias mentions several
monuments which were less
than life-size, <i>e. g.</i>, a horse among
the offerings of Phormis, which
he says was “much inferior in
size and shape to all other
statues of horses in the Altis,”<a id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a>
and the equestrian monuments already discussed. Even reliefs and
paintings, in some cases, were offered in lieu of larger monuments,
not only for reasons of economy, but also because they gave a better
representation of the contest. This custom was common at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
lesser games, especially at the <i>Panathenaia</i>.<a id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> Pausanias mentions
painted iconic reliefs vowed by girl runners at the games in honor
of Hera at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> On an Attic vase in Munich a victor is represented
as holding an iconic votive <i>pinax</i> in his hands.<a id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> Pausanias
speaks of a painting by Timainetos at Athens, which represented a boy
carrying hydriæ,<a id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> and one of a wrestler by the same artist in the
Pinakotheke on the Akropolis. Pliny mentions paintings, the works of
great masters, representing victors: thus the <i>currentes quadrigae</i> by the
elder Aristeides of Thebes,<a id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> a <i>victor certamine gymnico palmam tenens</i>
by Eupompos,<a id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> an athlete by Zeuxis,<a id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> the victor Aratos with a trophy
by Leontiskos,<a id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> an athlete by Protogenes,<a id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> two hoplite runners by
Parrhasios,<a id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> a <i>luctator tubicenque</i> by Antidotos and a warrior by the
same artist, in Athens,<a id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> which represented a man fighting with a shield,
and a man anointing himself, the work of the painter Theoros.<a id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a></p>

<p>Apparently the Hellanodikai allowed but one statue for each victory.
Aischines the Elean had two victories and two statues.<a id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> Dikon of
Kaulonia and Syracuse had three victories and three statues.<a id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> The
Spartan Lykinos had two victories and two statues by Myron, but we
have already said that the second statue was probably that of his
charioteer, the two forming part of an equestrian group.<a id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> Kapros of
Elis won two victories and had as many statues.<a id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> On the other hand
Troilos of Elis, who won in two events, had only one statue.<a id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> Similarly
Arkesilaos of Sparta had two victories in the chariot-race and
only one statue.<a id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> Xenombrotos of Cos, who appears to have won
once only, had, however, two monuments, one mentioned by Pausanias
and the other known to us from the recovered inscription.<a id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> But this
last case seems to be the only known exception.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<p>When the victor was unable to set up his monument, whether because
of youth, poverty, early death, or other reason, sometimes the
privilege was utilized by a relative, a friend, or by his native city. In
any case it was a private affair with which the Elean officials had no
concern. We have examples, consequently, of the statue being set up
by the son,<a id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> father (especially in recovered inscriptions after the time
of Augustus),<a id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> mother,<a id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> and brother;<a id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> also several examples of statues
reared in honor of athletes by fellow citizens.<a id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> There are cases
in which the trainer set up the statue.<a id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> Frequently the native city
performed the duty, dedicating the statue either at Olympia or in the
victor’s city. Thus Oibotas, who won the stade-race in Ol. 6 (&#8239;=&#8239;756
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), had a statue at Olympia which was erected by the Achæan state
out of deference to a command of the Delphian oracle in Ol. 80 (&#8239;=&#8239;460
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> The statue of Agenor, by Polykleitos the Younger, a boy wrestler
from Thebes, was dedicated by the confederacy of Phokis, because
his father was a public friend of the nation.<a id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> The boy runner Herodotos
of Klazomenai had a statue erected by his native town at Olympia
because he was the first victor from there.<a id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> Philinos of Kos had a
statue set up by the people of Kos at Olympia “because of glory won,”
for he was victor five times in running at Olympia, four at Delphi,
four at Nemea, and eleven at the Isthmus.<a id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> Hermesianax of Kolophon
had a statue at Olympia erected by his city.<a id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> The pancratiast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
Promachos of Pellene had two statues erected to him by his fellow citizens,
one at Olympia, the other in Pellene.<a id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> We know of three state
dedications of statues at Olympia from inscriptions, those of Aristophon
of Athens,<a id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> of Epitherses of Erythrai,<a id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> and of Polyxenos by
the people of Zakynthos.<a id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> Lichas of Sparta, at a date when the
Spartans were excluded from the games, entered his chariot in the
name of the Theban people, and Pausanias says that his victory was so
entered on the Elean register.<a id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> We learn from the <i>OxyrhynchusPapyri</i>
that the public horse of the Argives won at Olympia in Ol. 75
(&#8239;=&#8239;480 <i>B.&nbsp;C.</i>) and the public chariot in Ol. 77 (&#8239;=&#8239;472 <i>B.&nbsp;C.</i>).<a id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> In these
latter two cases the public was directly interested, and had there
been monuments erected to commemorate the victories they would
naturally have been set up by the state.</p>

<p>It has been wrongly assumed that monuments of boy victors were
dedicated in the name of their parents or relatives.<a id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> On the contrary,
we have examples dating back to the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> of boys
setting up statues at Olympia. Thus the inscription from the base of
the statue of Tellon, who won in the boys’ boxing match in Ol. 77 (&#8239;=&#8239;472
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), states that he dedicated his own statue.<a id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> Pausanias says that
the Eleans allowed the boy wrestler Kratinos from Aigeira to erect a
statue of his trainer.<a id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> Of course the boy might need assistance in the
undertaking, but this again was no concern of the Elean officials, who
granted the privilege to the victor and not to his relatives. Usually
the statue of a victor was erected soon after the victory. We have
some examples of the statue being erected immediately after the victory,
especially in the case of men victors. Thus Pausanias says that
the victor Eubotas of Kyrene, in consequence of a Libyan oracle foretelling
his victory in the foot-race, had his statue made before coming
to Olympia and erected it “the very day on which he was proclaimed
victor.”<a id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> The famous Milo of Kroton spectacularly carried his statue
into the Altis on his back before he entered the contest.<a id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> There are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
also examples of statues being erected long after the victory, sometimes
centuries later. We have already mentioned that a statue was erected
to Oibotas in Ol. 80, though his victory was won in Ol. 6. Chionis, who
won in running races in Ols. 28–31 (&#8239;=&#8239;668–656 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>) had a statue by
Myron erected to his memory Ol. 77 or 78 (&#8239;=&#8239;472 or 468 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> Cheilon
of Patrai, twice victor in wrestling between Ols. (?) 103 and 115 (&#8239;=&#8239;368
and 320 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), had his statue set up after his death.<a id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> Polydamas of
Skotoussa won his victory in the pankration in Ol. 93 (&#8239;=&#8239;408 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), but
his statue by Lysippos could not have been erected until many years
later.<a id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> Glaukos, who won the boys’ boxing-match in Ol. 65 (&#8239;=&#8239;520 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>),
had a statue by the Aeginetan sculptor Glaukias much later.<a id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> In the
case of boy victors, the time between boyhood and coming of age was
often so short that in many cases we may assume that the statue was
set up some time after the victory.<a id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></p>

<h3>HONORS PAID TO VICTORS BY THEIR NATIVE CITIES.</h3>

<p>Since the victor was deemed the representative of the state, he often
received a more substantial reward than a statue erected at the cost of
his fellow citizens. The herald, in proclaiming his victory, proclaimed
also the name of his town, which thus shared in his success. At
Athens it was customary for a victor at the great games to receive a
reward of money. To encourage an interest in athletics there, Solon
established money prizes for victorious athletes. We have already said
that 100 drachmæ were given to a victor at the Isthmus, while 500
were allotted to one at Olympia. Solon further ordained that victors
should eat at the Prytaneion at the public expense.<a id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> Probably other
Greek states followed the Athenian custom. We know from an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
inscription that the Panathenaic victors in the stade-race received 50
amphoræ of oil, the pancratiast 40, and others 30.<a id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> Later, in Rome,
victors had special privileges granted them, including maintenance
at the public expense, a privilege which Mæcenas advised the emperor
Augustus to limit to victors at Olympia, Delphi, and Rome.<a id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> Augustus
in other ways enlarged the privileges of athletes.<a id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> When we consider
the intimate connection between religion and athletics and the Panhellenic
fame of a victor at the great games, we can easily understand
the indignation of the native town when its athletes did anything dishonorable.
Sometimes a victor was bribed to appear as the citizen of
some other state. Thus Astylos of Kroton, who won in running
races in Ols. 73–76 (&#8239;=&#8239;488–476 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), had himself proclaimed in his last
two contests a Syracusan to please King Hiero. The citizens of his
native town burned his house and pulled down his statue, which had
been placed there in the temple of Hera.<a id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> The Cretan Sotades, who
won the long running race in Ol. 99 (&#8239;=&#8239;384 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), was bribed at the next
Olympiad by the city of Ephesos to proclaim himself an Ephesian, and
was in consequence exiled.<a id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> Dikon, a victor in running races at the
beginning of the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, proclaimed himself first a citizen
of Kaulonia, but later, “for a sum of money,” entered the men’s
contest as a Syracusan.<a id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> Sometimes such attempts at bribery proved
unsuccessful. Thus the father of the boy boxer Antipatros of Miletos,
who won in Ol. 98 (&#8239;=&#8239;388 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), accepted a bribe from some Syracusans,
who were bringing an offering to Olympia from Dionysios, to let the
boy be proclaimed a Syracusan. But the boy himself refused the
bribe and had inscribed on his statue by the younger Polykleitos that
he was a Milesian, the first Ionian to dedicate a statue at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a>
The Spartan chariot victor Lichas has already been mentioned as
having entered his chariot in the name of Thebes. The reason was
that at the time the Spartans were excluded from entering the games at
Olympia. He won, and in his excitement tied a ribbon on his charioteer
with his own hands, thereby showing that the horses belonged to him
and not to Thebes. For this infraction of the rules he, though an aged
man, was punished by the umpires by scourging.<a id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> A more disgraceful
act was selling out, of which we have two examples at Olympia. The
Thessalian Eupolos bribed his three adversaries in boxing to let him win.
All four were fined and from the money six bronze statues of Zeus,
known as <i>Zanes</i>, were erected at the entrance to the stadion, inscribed
with elegiac verses which warned future athletes against repeating such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
attempts.<a id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> More than fifty years later Kallippos, a pentathlete of
Athens, bribed his opponents and, being detected, all were fined and
from the money, finally collected from the recalcitrant Athenians
through the influence of the oracle at Delphi, six more <i>Zanes</i> were
erected.<a id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> Straton (or Stratonikos), of Alexandria, won in wrestling
and the pankration on the same day in Ol. 178 (&#8239;=&#8239;68 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>). In the
wrestling match he had two adversaries, Eudelos and Philostratos of
Rhodes. The latter had bribed Eudelos to sell out and, being detected,
had to pay a fine. Out of this money another <i>Zan</i> was set up and still
another at the cost of the Rhodians.<a id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> In Ol. 192 (&#8239;=&#8239;12 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>) and in Ol.
226 (&#8239;=&#8239;125 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span>), we hear of fines for such corruption out of which additional
<i>Zanes</i> were erected.<a id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> In Ol. 201 (&#8239;=&#8239;25 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span>) Sarapion, a pancratiast
from Alexandria, became so afraid of his antagonist that he fled the
day before the contest and was fined—the only case recorded of an
athlete being fined for cowardice at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> In Ol. 218 (&#8239;=&#8239;93 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span>)
another Alexandrine, named Apollonios, was fined for arriving too
late for the games at Olympia. His excuse of being detained by winds
was found to be false, and it was discovered that he had been making
money on the games in Ionia.<a id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a></p>

<p>Cases of bribery were known at other games. A third-century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> inscription from Epidauros records how three athletes were fined
one thousand staters each διὰ τὸ φθείρειν τοὺς ἀγῶνας.<a id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> The venality
of Isthmian victors is shown by the account of a competitor who
promised a rival three thousand drachmæ to let him win and then, on
winning on his merits, refused to pay, though the defeated contestant
swore on the altar of Poseidon that he had been promised the amount.<a id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a>
The emperor Nero, in order to win in singing at the Isthmus, had to
resort to force. A certain Epeirote singer refused to withdraw unless
he received ten talents. Nero, to save himself from defeat, sent a band
of men who pummelled his antagonist so that he could not sing.<a id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></p>

<p>Often the home-coming of a victor at one of the national games was
the occasion for a public celebration. Sometimes the whole city turned
out to meet the hero.<a id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> The victory was recorded on pillars, and poets
composed songs in its honor which were sung by choruses of girls and
boys. Sometimes a statue was set up in the agora or on the Akropolis.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
In the cities of Magna Græcia and Sicily such adulation of Olympic
victors became at times very extravagant. Thus Exainetos of Akragas,
who won the stade-race in Ols. 91 and 92 (&#8239;=&#8239;416–412 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), was brought
into the city in a four-horse chariot drawn by his fellow-citizens, and
was escorted by 300 men in two-horse chariots drawn by white horses.<a id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a>
It is also in the West that we first hear of victors being worshipped as
heroes or gods, though the custom soon took root in Greece. It was
but natural to account for the great strength of famous athletes by
assigning to them divine origin and by worshipping them after death.<a id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a>
Philippos of Kroton, who won in an unknown contest about Ol. 65
(&#8239;=&#8239;520 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), had a <i>heroön</i> erected in his honor by the people of Egesta
in Sicily on account of his beauty, in which he surpassed all his contemporaries,
and he was worshipped after his death as a hero.<a id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> The
famous boxer Euthymos of Lokroi Epizephyrioi, who won in Ols. 74,
76, 77 (&#8239;=&#8239;484, 476, 472 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), was worshipped even before his death
and was looked upon as the son of no earthly father, but of the river-god
Kaikinos.<a id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> Fabulous feats were ascribed to him, <i>e. g.</i>, the expulsion
of the Black Spirit from Temessa.<a id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> During and after his lifetime
sacrifices were offered in his honor.<a id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> The equally famed boxer and
pancratiast Theagenes of Thasos, the opponent of Euthymos, who
won in Ols. 75 and 76 (&#8239;=&#8239;480 and 476 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), was heroized after his death.<a id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a>
The Thasians maintained that his father was Herakles.<a id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> The boxer
Kleomedes of Astypalaia, who won in Ol. 71 (&#8239;=&#8239;496 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), was honored
as a hero after death.<a id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> Having killed Ikkos, his opponent, he became
crazed with grief. Pausanias recounts his curious death.<a id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> The worship
of such athletes was supposed to bestow physical strength on their
adorers and consequently statues were erected to them in many places
and were thought to be able to cure illnesses.<a id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> The life of a successful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
athlete was looked upon as especially happy. In Aristophanes’ <i>Plutus</i>,
Hermes deserts the gods and serves Plutus “the presider over contests,”
thinking no service more profitable to the god of wealth than holding
contests in music and athletics.<a id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> Plato thought an Olympic victor’s
life was the most blessed of all from a material point of view.<a id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> In the
myth of Er the soul of Atalanta chooses the body of an athlete, on seeing
“the great rewards bestowed on an athlete.”<a id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> The great Rhodian
pancratiast Dorieus, who won in Ols. 87, 88, 89 (&#8239;=&#8239;432–424 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), was
taken prisoner by Athens during the Peloponnesian war, but was freed
because of his exploits at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> The honor in which a victor was
held may also be judged by the story of the Spartan ephor Cheilon,
who died of joy while embracing his victorious son Damagetos.<a id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a>
To quote from Ernest Gardner: “The extraordinary, almost superhuman
honours paid to the victors at the great national contests
made them a theme for the sculptor hardly less noble than gods and
heroes, and more adapted for the display of his skill, as trained by the
observation of those exercises which led to the victory.”<a id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> Some of
the greatest artists were employed, and great poets from Simonides
of Keos down, including such names as Bacchylides and Pindar, were
employed in singing their praises. Although it must be confessed
that the majority of the artists of victor statues at Olympia are little
known or wholly unknown masters, Pausanias mentions among them
such renowned names as Hagelaïdas, Pythagoras, Kalamis, Myron, Polykleitos,
Lysippos, and possibly Pheidias. Certain other great names,
however, are absent from his lists, <i>e. g.</i>, Euphranor, Kresilas, Praxiteles,
and Skopas. Such extravagant reverence of Olympic and other victors
as we have outlined met, of course, with violent protests all through
Greek history, just as the excessive popularity of athletics has in our
time. The philosopher Xenophanes of Kolophon, who died 480 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>,
was scandalized at the offering of divine honors to athletes.<a id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> While he
denounced the popularity of athletics, Euripides later denounced the professionalism
which had begun to creep in after the middle of the fifth
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> Plato, though a strong advocate of practical physical
training for war, was opposed to the vain spirit of competition in the
athletics of his day. He complained that professional athletes paid
excessive attention to diet, slept their lives away, and were in danger
of becoming brutalized.<a id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a> The last attack on professional athletics in
point of time was made in the second century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span> by Galen, in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
<i>Exhortation to the Arts</i>.<a id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> In this essay the eminent physician contended
that the athlete was a benefit neither to himself nor to the state.
When we study the brutal portraits of prize-fighters on the contemporary
mosaics of the Baths of Caracalla at Rome, we can see to what
depths the old athletic ideal had sunk, and the justness of his rebuke.<a id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a></p>

<h3>VOTIVE CHARACTER OF VICTOR DEDICATIONS.</h3>

<p>That chariot and hippic monuments were votive in character can
scarcely be doubted. Pausanias distinguishes between gymnic victors
and equestrian ones.<a id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> All authorities agree that equestrian monuments
were different in origin and character from those of other victors.<a id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a>
Gardiner believes that if the Olympic games developed out of a single
event, it was not the stade-race, but the chariot-race or heavy-armed-race.
He shows that the custom of making the stade runner eponymous
for the Olympiad is not earlier than the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, and did
not arise from the importance of that event, but from the accident of
its coming first on the program and first on the list of victors.<a id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a> Equestrian
monuments were dedicated at Olympia all through antiquity,
from the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> to the second <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span> The oldest was that of
the Spartan Euagoras already mentioned, who won in the chariot-race
three times in Ols. (?) 58–60 (&#8239;=&#8239;548–540 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a> The latest dated
example is that of L. Minicius Natalis of Rome, who won in Ol. 227
(&#8239;=&#8239;129 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> Some of the inscriptions pertaining to equestrian groups
are in verse,<a id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> while others are in prose.<a id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> Most of them have the usual
dedicatory word ἀνέθηκε,<a id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> or the formula Διὶ Ὀλυμπίῳ,<a id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> while others
have the word ἔστησε<a id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> and a few have no dedicatory word at all.<a id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a></p>

<p>The question arises, then, whether ordinary victor monuments in
the Altis were votive in the sense that these equestrian ones were, or
merely honors granted to the victors. The crown of wild olive was
merely a temporary reward suiting the occasion of the victory. The
privilege of setting up a statue was granted in order to perpetuate
the fame of that occasion. In a well-known passage Pausanias<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
makes a sweeping generalization about monuments at Athens and
Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a> He says that all objects on the Akropolis—including
statues—were ἀναθήματα or votive offerings, while some of those at
Olympia were dedicated to the god, but that the statues of athletes
were mere prizes of victory. In another passage<a id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a> also, in distinguishing
the various sorts of monuments at Olympia, he expressly
says that the statues of athletes were not devoted to Zeus, but were
marks of honor (ἐν ἄθλου λόγῳ) bestowed on the victors. These
statements of the Periegete have given rise to a good deal of fruitless
discussion. Furtwaengler follows Pausanias in saying that the right
of setting up statues was <i>ein wesentlicher Theil des Siegespreises</i>.<a id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a>
That such erections at Olympia were considered as high honors is
implied by the wording of many of the inscriptions which have
been recovered from the bases of the statues. Thus on that of the
boxer Euthymos are the words εἰκόνα δ’ ἔστησεν τήνδε βροτοῖς ἐσορᾶν.<a id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a>
Furtwaengler, therefore, has promulgated the theory that the victor
statues at Olympia were in no sense votive, though they were considered
to be the property of the god in whose grove they stood. He
cites the fact that the inscribed bases of such monuments down to the
first century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, with the exception of a few metrical epigrams,
make no mention of dedications, and that in these exceptions the
word ἀνέθηκε was added for metrical reasons,<a id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> while during the same
centuries regular votive offerings (ἀναθῆματα) invariably have the
word ἀνέθηκε.<a id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a> One inscription, that from the base of the statue
of Euthymos of Lokroi, is both metrical and in prose;<a id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> but it seems
to have been changed later in two places, the second line originally
ending in a pentameter, and the third line, with ἀνέθηκε, being
added afterwards.<a id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> Also the prose inscription<a id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a> referred by Roehl to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
statue of the wrestler Milo is rejected by Dittenberger. The oldest
prose inscription which makes a votive offering out of a victor statue
at Olympia is that of Thaliarchos, who won his second victory in boxing
some time between 40 and 30 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a> Then follow certain prose inscriptions
of imperial times.<a id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a> Dittenberger concludes that for four hundred
years there is no case of such a dedication.<a id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> From the evidence of the
inscriptions from statue bases, therefore, it is clear that the distinction
made by Pausanias between honor and victor statues did not hold
good in his day, since the words ἀνάθημα and ἀνέθηκε were then
used on victor monuments at Olympia, as the inscriptions of the
imperial age just cited show, but that it did hold good for centuries
before the Roman period. Pausanias must have based his statement,
therefore, not on observation, but on the words of some earlier writer.<a id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a>
Furtwaengler’s reasoning has been followed pretty generally by archæologists.<a id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a>
While some, however, leave the question in doubt,<a id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a> others
are opposed to the idea that these statues were not votive. Thus R.
Schoell believes that the victor monuments were as truly ἀναθήματα
as the olive crowns.<a id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> Reisch, who has discussed the question at
length,<a id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a> believes, in opposition to the earlier view of Furtwaengler,
that everything within the Altis must always <i>ipso facto</i> have been
regarded as dedications to the god. This would explain the frequent
omission of the name of the god, which would be superfluous, the victor
being content with inscribing his own name and the contest in which
he was victorious. Even the name of the contest does not always
appear.<a id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a> Reisch explains the omission of the formula ἀνέθηκε in
earlier inscriptions on the ground of epigrammatic brevity.<a id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a></p>

<p>The truth must lie somewhere between the extremes represented by
the views of Furtwaengler and Reisch. Some athlete statues may have
been votive, while others were not. Thus Rouse argues<a id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a> that origi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>nally
all victor statues at Olympia were as truly votive as equestrian
groups, and as truly as those athlete statues continued to be, which were
dedicated in the victors’ native towns. Those inscribed with ἀνέθηκε at
Olympia must have been votive, for we should take the dedicator at his
word, instead of believing the formula to be added merely to make the
verse scan.<a id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> There is no reason why an athlete should not dedicate
a statue of himself, representing himself as forever standing in the presence
of the god, as well as a diskos or jumping-weights; for it was customary
to make votive offerings representative of the events, and this
could be done best by presenting the athlete in a statue which showed
the characteristic attitude or the appropriate attributes. Rouse furthermore
believes that a change was slowly wrought in the course of
centuries, by which the original votive offering became a means of
self-glorification. Equestrian victors owed their victories not to themselves,
but to their horses, cars, drivers, and jockeys; in such cases the
group was a thing apart from the owner. Only seldom did such victors
dedicate statues of themselves alone. Even when the victor added
a statue of himself to the group, still it was the chariot and not the
statue which was emphasized.<a id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> On the other hand the ordinary gymnic
victor relied on himself—on his strength, endurance, courage, and
other qualities; and in representing the contest the victor himself had
to be represented. Consequently, by the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, if not
earlier, the statues of athletes had become memorials of personal glory.</p>

<h3>MISCELLANEOUS MEMORIALS TO VICTORS.</h3>

<p>A statue was not the only memorial erected in honor of an Olympic
victor, though it was by far the commonest. We have already mentioned
the bronze inscribed diskos dedicated by the pentathlete P.
Asklepiades in the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span><a id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> A green stone leaping-weight
inscribed with the name Κῳδίας appears to have been dedicated
by a victor.<a id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> In two cases stelæ were set up in honor of victors.<a id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a> A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
curious dedication was a bronze chapel, which the Sikyonian tyrant
Myron dedicated to Apollo at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a> In later days it became
part of the treasury of the Sikyonians.<a id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a> Outside Olympia various
monuments commemorating Olympic victors were set up. These will
be discussed in Chapter VIII.</p>

<h3>HONORARY STATUES.</h3>

<p>At Olympia, as elsewhere in Greece, statues were set up to men
<i>honoris causa</i>. Such statues would be dedicated by admirers, either
individuals or states. They were in no sense intended to honor the
god, though at Olympia they might be classed as ἀναθήματα, just as
victor statues, merely because they were erected in the sacred precinct.
They were granted to individuals not as a privilege, as victor statues
were, but as free gifts. Dio Chrysostom gives the difference between
victor statues—which he classes as ἀναθήματα—and such honor statues
in these words: ταῦτα (<i>i. e.</i>, victor statues) γάρ ἐστιν ἀναθήματα·
αἱ δ’ εἰκόνες τιμαί· κἀκεῖνα (victor statues) δέδοται τοῖς θεοῖς, ταῦτα δὲ
(honor statues) τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς ἀνδράσιν οἵπερ εἰσὶν ἔγγιστα αὐτῶν.<a id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> Pliny
records that the Athenians inaugurated the custom of a state setting up
statues in honor of men at the public expense with the statues of the
tyrannicides Harmodios and Aristogeiton by the sculptor Antenor,
which were erected in 509 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, the year in which the tyrants were
expelled.<a id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a> He adds that a “refined ambition” led to a universal adoption
of the custom and that statues began to adorn public places everywhere
and later on even private houses. The custom grew apace in the
later history of Greece. Demetrios of Phaleron is said to have had
over three hundred statues erected in his honor during his short régime
of about a year in Athens. The Diadochoi and the Roman emperors
enthusiastically took over the custom. Pliny gives several Roman
examples of it.<a id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a></p>

<p>At Olympia Pausanias mentions honorary statues erected to thirty-five
men for various reasons.<a id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a> To several of these men more than one
statue was erected.<a id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> The greater number of these statues were erected
to kings and princes, to those of Sparta,<a id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> Athens,<a id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> Epeiros,<a id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a> Sicily,<a id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
Macedonia, and Alexander’s Empire.<a id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> One was erected in honor of
the philosopher Aristotle,<a id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> one in honor of the rhetorician Gorgias of
Leontini,<a id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> one in honor of a hunter,<a id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> another in honor of a flute-player,<a id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a>
and many others in honor of public and private men. These statues
were set up for various reasons. Archidamas III of Sparta had his
statues erected to his memory because he was the only Spartan king
who died abroad and did not receive a formal burial. Kylon had a
statue erected by the Aitolians because he freed the Eleans from the
tyranny of Aristotimos.<a id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> Pythes of Abdera was thus honored by his
soldiers because of his military prowess.<a id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> Philonides of Crete was, as
we learn from the recovered inscription on his statue base, the courier of
Alexander the Great.<a id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> Pythokritos was honored for his flute-playing,
though he does not appear to have been a victor.<a id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a> The Palaians of
Kephallenia honored Timoptolis of Elis,<a id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a> and the Aitolians honored
the Elean Olaidas<a id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> for unknown reasons. At least seven, if not
eight, of those thus honored with statues were Eleans. Some of the
men who had honor statues were also victors at Olympia, a fact which
would appear on the inscribed base. Thus Aratos, the son of Kleinias
of Sikyon, the statesman, had a statue erected to him by the Corinthians.
This was doubtless an honor statue, though Pausanias also says he was a
chariot-victor.<a id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> On the other hand, the statue erected in honor of the
pentathlete Stomios was probably a victor monument, though Pausanias
says that its inscription records that he was an Elean cavalry
general who challenged the enemy to a duel, in which he was slain.<a id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a> In
some cases it is hard to decide whether the statue is honorary or victor
in character. In the course of time honor statues multiplied, while
those of athletes decreased. The recovered inscriptions on the latter
decrease steadily in the fourth and third centuries <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, revive again
in the second and first, and decrease in the first Christian century.
They cease almost entirely after the middle of the second century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF VICTOR STATUES
AT OLYMPIA.</small></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plates 2–7 and Figures 3–8.</span></p>

<p>Only a few insignificant remnants of the forest of victor statues
which once stood in the Altis at Olympia were unearthed by the German
excavators. Most of these statues already in antiquity had
been carried off to Italy,<a id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> while those which escaped the spoliation
of the Roman masters of Greece were destroyed at the hands of the
invading hordes of barbarians in the early Dark Ages. Consequently
only here and there in modern museums can isolated fragments of
these originals be discovered, which have accidentally survived the
ravages of time and man.</p>

<p>In the almost complete absence of originals, therefore, we depend
for our knowledge of them on a variety of sources. In attempting
to reconstruct them we have two main sources of information to
aid us, the literary and the archæological. To the former belong the
many inscriptions found on the statue bases recovered at Olympia,
which contain the name and native city of the victor, the athletic
contest in which his victory was won, and frequently some account of his
former athletic history; epigrams preserved in the Greek anthologies
and elsewhere, some of which agree with those inscribed on the statue
bases; more or less definite statements of scholiasts and the classical
writers in general, especially the detailed account of the monuments of
Olympia contained in the fifth and sixth books of the Ἑλλάδος περιήγησις
of Pausanias, who visited the Altis during the reign of Marcus Aurelius
Antoninus,<a id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a> and also the somewhat systematic treatment of Greek
sculptors and their works in the elder Pliny’s chapters on the History
of Art.<a id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> To the latter source belong the remnants of statues in bronze
and marble found at Olympia, as well as the recovered bases, on many
of which the extant footmarks enable us to recover the pose of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
statues which formerly stood upon them. Finally, in reconstructing
these athlete statues, an intimate knowledge of Greek sculpture in all
its phases and periods is essential. Here, as in the general study of
Greek sculpture, where the destruction of originals has been almost
complete, we are largely dependent on Roman copies which were
executed by more or less skilled workmen, chiefly for wealthy Roman
patrons of art who wished to use them to decorate the public buildings,
baths, palaces, and villas of Rome and other Italian cities. A
careful study of these copies has evolved a series of groups, which have
been assigned with more or less probability to this or that artist.<a id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a>
Representations of the various poses of the athlete statues of Olympia
and elsewhere are found also on every sort of sculptured and painted
works—reliefs, vases, coins, gems—which are, therefore, valuable in
any attempt to reconstruct the attitude of a given statue.</p>

<p>Taking into account all these sources of knowledge, it has been
possible to reach tolerable certainty in reconstructing the main types
of these victor monuments, and in identifying schools, masters, and
individual works. This identification of athlete statues, especially
those belonging to the fifth and fourth centuries <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, among the
countless Roman works which people modern museums, has already
been achieved in many cases by archælogical investigations. The work
of many masters of the archaic period and of the most important bronze
sculptors of the great period of Greek art has been illustrated by such
ascriptions; especially that of Myron, who represented figures in rhythmic
action full of life and vigor; of the elder Polykleitos, who was a
master in representing standing figures at rest fashioned according to a
mathematical system of proportions; of Lysippos, who introduced a
new canon of proportions in opposition to that of his predecessor
Polykleitos, and who inaugurated the naturalistic tendency in Greek
art, which was destined to he carried to such unbecoming lengths in
succeeding centuries. The further identification of such statues, as
our knowledge of the tendencies and traditions of the schools of Greek
sculpture and our sources of information about athletic art become
more and more extended, will be one of the most important tasks of
the archæologist in the future.</p>

<p>Before discussing the appearance of individual types of these monuments,
we shall consider certain general characteristics common to all
of them. Long ago K. O. Mueller<a id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a> summed up the common features
of victor statues in these words: <i>Kurzgelocktes Haar, tuechtige Glieder,
eine kraeftige Ausbildung der Gestalt und verhaeltnissmaessig kleine
Koepfe characterisiren die ganze Gattung von Figuren; die zerschlagenen
Ohren und die hervorgetriebenen Muskeln insbesondere die Faustkaempfer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
und Pankratiasten.</i> Though in the main this excellent summary still
holds good, we are now in a position to correct it in part and to add
other equally characteristic features to it. We shall briefly discuss,
therefore, in the light of recent investigations, certain of the characteristics
common to this <i>genre</i> of sculpture—the material and size of
these statues, their nudity and fashion of wearing the hair, their twofold
division into iconic and aniconic, their proportions, and, lastly, the
assimilation of their appearance to well-known types of hero or god.</p>

<h3>SIZE OF VICTOR STATUES.</h3>

<p>In another section<a id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> we show that the overwhelming majority of the
statues in the Altis were of bronze, though other materials, stone
and wood, were also used in some cases. As to the size of these
statues, no hard and fast rule seems to have been followed, but
we may assume from the evidence at hand that they were in general
life-size.<a id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a> Lucian would have us believe that the Hellanodikai
did not allow victors to set up statues larger than life.<a id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> We know,
however, that there were exceptions to such a rule. In all probability
the statue of Polydamas of Skotoussa by Lysippos, which Pausanias says
stood on a high pedestal, was larger than life-size, if we may conjecture
from its elevated position and the probable source of Pausanias’ remark
that he “was the tallest of men, if we except the so-called heroes and
the mortal race which preceded the heroes.”<a id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> The traces of footprints
on the recovered pedestal of the statue of the Athenian pancratiast
Kallias by the sculptor Mikon show that the statue was larger
than life-size.<a id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> The footprints on the base of the statue of the Rhodian
boxer Eukles by the Argive Naukydes are about 33 cm. long, and so the
statue was slightly over life-size.<a id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> We know the actual size of at least
two of these Olympic statues. The scholiast on Pindar, <i>Ol.</i> VII, Argum.,
on the basis of a fragment from Aristotle’s lost work on the Olympic
victors and one from the little-known writer Apollas Ponticus,<a id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a> says
that the statue of the Rhodian boxer Diagoras was 4 cubits and 5 fingers
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>tall,<a id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a> <i>i. e.</i>, about 6 feet 4.5 inches, somewhat over life-size.<a id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> From
the same scholiast we learn that the statue of the son of Diagoras,
the pancratiast Damagetos, was 4 cubits high, or less than that of
the father by 5 fingers, and consequently just under 6 feet.<a id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> The
footprints on the base of the statue of the boxer Aristion by the elder
Polykleitos are 29 cm. long, and so the statue was just life-size.<a id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a> There
are several examples of such life-size statues,<a id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a> while others are slightly
below life-size.<a id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> The Polykleitan statue of a boxer in Kassel is under
life-size.<a id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a> The marble head of a statue found at Olympia, which we
ascribe to Philandridas, the Akarnanian pancratiast, by Lysippos,
(Frontispiece and Fig. <a href="#f69">69</a>) is also under life-size,<a id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a> as is also that of the
pancratiast Agias found at Delphi (Pl. <a href="#p27">27</a> and Fig. <a href="#f68">68</a>). These two are
in harmony with Pliny’s statement that Lysippos made the heads of
his statues relatively small.<a id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> Perhaps this statement of Pliny was
the basis of the opinion of Mueller recorded above that “comparatively
small heads” characterize the whole <i>genre</i> of victor statues.
We have in the preceding chapter mentioned the marble fragments
of the statues of boy victors, two-fifths to two-thirds life-size, found at
Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a> The two marble helmeted heads of the archaic period
found there, which we shall later ascribe to hoplite victors (Fig. <a href="#f30">30</a>),
are exactly life-size.<a id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> Of the bronze fragments recovered at Olympia,<a id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a>
the head of a boxer of the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> (Fig. <a href="#f61">61</a>, A and B)
is life-size,<a id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a> while the extraordinarily beautifully sculptured right arm
ascribed to a boy victor by Furtwaengler<a id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a> is a little under life-size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<h3>NUDITY OF VICTOR STATUES.</h3>

<p>Most of the victor statues at Olympia were nude.<a id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a> In the early
period all athletes wore the loin-cloth. Cretan frescoes show it was
the custom in the early Mediterranean world. The athletes of Homer
girded themselves on entering the games of Patroklos,<a id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a> and the girdle
appears in the earliest athletic scenes on vases.<a id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a> Throughout the historic
period, however, the Greeks entered their contests in complete nudity,
and this nudity naturally was carried over into athletic sculpture.
Pliny’s<a id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a> statement, <i>Graeca res nihil velare</i>, is, therefore, correct, despite
another of Philostratos to the effect that at Delphi, at the Isthmus,
and everywhere except at Olympia, the athlete wore the coarse mantle.<a id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a>
The beginning of the change from wearing the loin-cloth to
complete nudity was ascribed to an accident. The Megarian runner
Orsippos in the 15th Ol. (&#8239;=&#8239;720 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>) dropped his loin-cloth
while running, either accidentally or because it impeded him.<a id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a> The
story was commemorated by an epigram, perhaps by Simonides,
which was inscribed on his tomb at Megara.<a id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a> A copy of this epigram
in the Megarian dialect, executed in late Roman or Byzantine times,
when the original had become illegible, was discovered at Megara in
1769 and shows that its original was the source of Pausanias’ remarks.<a id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a>
Philostratos says that athletes contended nude at Olympia, either because
of the summer heat or a mishap which befell the woman Pherenike
of Rhodes. She accompanied her son, the boy boxer Peisirhodos,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
to Olympia disguised as a trainer, and in her joy at his victory she
leaped over the barrier and disclosed her sex.<a id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a> The practice does not
appear to have become universal with all athletes in all the competitions
at Olympia until some time after Orsippos’ day, since
Thukydides says the abandonment of the girdle took place shortly
before his time and that in his day it was still retained by certain foreigners,
notably Asiatics, in boxing and wrestling matches.<a id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a> The
change is not illustrated in sculpture. The earliest victor statues,
<i>i. e.</i>, those of the “Apollo” type, are all nude. The nudity of this
type shows an essential difference between Greek and foreigner and
also between the later Greek and his rude ancestor. Plato gives the
use of the loin-cloth as an example of convention, by which what
seems peculiar to one generation becomes usual to another.<a id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a> We see
the change, however, in vase-paintings. The loin-cloth is common
on seventh-century vases, but is gradually left off in later ones.</p>

<p>There were exceptions to the rule of nudity. Statues of charioteers
were usually partly or wholly dressed in the long chiton, a custom
explained in various ways.<a id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a> The Delphi bronze <i>Charioteer</i> (Fig. <a href="#f66">66</a>)
is a good example of a draped one. Another <i>auriga</i> almost nude
is shown on a decadrachm of Akragas in the British Museum, dating
from the end of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a> There are also several examples
of nude charioteers.<a id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a> The Olympic runners and athletes
generally were also bareheaded and barefoot. The only exceptions
were the hoplite-runners, who wore helmets, and possibly charioteers,
who wore sandals.<a id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a> Statues of women victors also were draped.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
Though Ionian women could witness games,<a id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a> and Spartan girls took
part in athletic contests with boys,<a id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a> women were rigorously excluded
from crossing the Alpheios during the festival at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a> They
were allowed, however, to enter horses for the chariot-race and, if
victorious, to set up monuments.<a id="FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a> Only one woman was allowed to
witness the games, the priestess of the old earth cult of Demeter
Chamyne, who could sit at the altar in the stadion during the contests.<a id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a>
Pausanias notes but one exception of a woman infringing the rule of
admission, Pherenike, the mother of the Rhodian victor Peisirhodos
already mentioned. She was pardoned because her father, brothers,
and son were victors, but the umpires passed a law that thereafter
even trainers should be nude.<a id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a> While excluded from the games proper,
women had their own festival at Olympia in honor of Hera, which
was known as the <i>Heraia</i>. These games occurred every four years<a id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a>
and included a foot-race between virgins, in which the course
was one-sixth less than the stadion. The victress received an olive
crown and also a share of the cow sacrificed to Hera, and was
allowed to set up a painted picture of herself in the Heraion.<a id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a>
It has been generally assumed that the statue of a girl runner in
the Galleria dei Candelabri of the Vatican represents one of these
victresses (Plate 2),<a id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a> since Pausanias says they ran with their hair<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
down and wore a tunic which reached to just above the knees,
leaving the right shoulder bare to the breast. That the statue represents
a girl runner seems certain,<a id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a> but that it can be referred
to one of the Olympic girl victresses is doubtful. The description of
Pausanias fits it in many respects, except that the chiton of the
statue is too short, and he does not mention the girdle just below the
bosom. Furthermore, he does not mention statues of girl victresses,
but only pictures. Nothing can be argued from the palm-branch on
the tree-stump, except that the Roman copyist thought it the statue
of a victress. It does not necessarily refer to a victress at Olympia,
for Pausanias elsewhere says that the palm-branch was given at many
contests.<a id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a> The statue represents a young girl leaning forward awaiting
the signal to start,<a id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a> but it is impossible to say to what games we should
refer it. There were girls’ contests in and out of Greece—such as at
the <i>Dionysia</i> in Sparta<a id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a> and in her colony Kyrene.<a id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a> Such games were
also held in the stadion of Domitian at Rome.<a id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a> In fact the Palatine
estate of the Barberini, from whom the Vatican acquired the statue,
embraced the area of the old stadion of Domitian on the Palatine.
It is probably of Doric workmanship, as it certainly represents a Dorian
victress, though not necessarily by a Peloponnesian sculptor.<a id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a></p>

<h3>THE ATHLETIC HAIR-FASHION.</h3>


<div class="figcenter500"><p class="right">PLATE 2</p><a id="p2"></a>

<div class="caption">Marble Statue of a Girl Runner. Vatican Museum, Rome.</div>
</div>

<p>The assumption long held that short hair was always characteristic
of the athlete is incorrect.<a id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a> It is controverted equally by literary
evidence and by the monuments. The Homeric Greek took pride in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>his long hair,<a id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a> and doubtless the contestants at the games of Patroklos
in the Iliad had long hair. Long hair was worn by some Athenians
throughout Athenian history. From the end of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>,
long hair was regarded as a mark of effeminacy<a id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a> and was regularly
worn only by the knights.<a id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a> Short hair was worn as a sign of mourning
in Athens from early days down.<a id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a> Only the slaves regularly wore
very short hair in the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a> The change to short hair
in Athens was certainly due to the influence of the palæstra and to
athletics in general.<a id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> We see just the opposite custom in vogue in
Sparta. There, according to the code of Lykourgos,<a id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">480</a> men were compelled
to wear long hair and children short hair. Thus the heroes of
Leonidas entered the battle of Thermopylæ after combing their long
locks.<a id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a> After the Persian wars only children and men with laconizing
or aristocratic sympathies<a id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a> wore their hair long at Athens. When
boys arrived at the age of ἔφηβοι, they had their hair cut at the feast
of the οἰνιστήρια<a id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a> and dedicated it to a god.<a id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a> Soon after the Persian
war period, athletes wore their hair short. Before that time, the
wearing of long hair had already been discarded for obvious reasons in
wrestling.<a id="FNanchor_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a> Similarly, in boxing and the pankration long hair was
in the way, and was therefore early braided into two long plaits
which were wound around the head in a peculiar way and tied into a
knot at the top, the so-called Attic κρωβύλος, the oftenest mentioned
manner of dressing the hair in Greek literature.<a id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a> The oldest notice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
of this style of wearing the hair is found in a fragment of Asios.<a id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a> Herakleides
Ponticus<a id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">488</a> says it was used up to the time of the Persian wars.
The <i>locus classicus</i> is in Thukydides, who says it was worn in his day by
old people only.<a id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a> Earlier young men wore it,<a id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">490</a> but it went out of fashion
between 470 and 460 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> In this connection we should mention
that the professional athlete under the Roman Empire wore his
hair uncut and tied up in an unsightly topknot known as the <i>cirrus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">491</a></p>

<p>The monumental evidence bears out the literary. Thus, on old
Corinthian clay tablets freemen are represented with long hair, while
slaves have short hair.<a id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">492</a> Hydrias from Caere (Cerveteri) and paintings
from Klazomenai show that the Ionians wore their hair short for the
first time in the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, the custom not becoming general
until the fifth. Older Spartan monuments represent the hair long.<a id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">493</a>
Attic vases show long hair on men until the second half of the sixth
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, when the black-figured vase masters began to represent
them with short hair, a custom becoming general in the first half of the
fifth. In statuary the <i>Diskobolos</i> of Myron (Pls. 21, 26, and Figs. 34, 35)
has short hair, and most statues of athletes before it have long hair,
while most after it have short. Before the time of the <i>Diskobolos</i>, b.-f.
and early r.-f. vase-painters often represented athletes with braided hair
in the fashion of the warriors on the Aegina pediments. When short
hair began to be used on athlete statues, these older braids were often
replaced by victor bands.<a id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">494</a> We may roughly summarize by saying
that statues before the date of the <i>Diskobolos</i> which do not have long
hair are probably those of athletes and not of gods, and, in any case,
if they have braids bound up in the fashion of the κρωβύλος, they are
almost always statues of athletes.<a id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">495</a> As for short hair on representations
of gods, Furtwaengler has shown that it appears only after the
middle of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">496</a> Prior to that date the hair of divinities
fell over the neck and shoulders in curls, as in the statue of the
<i>Olympian Zeus</i> by Pheidias. By the time of Perikles, however, short
curly hair reached only to the nape of the neck on statues of Zeus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
and this style frequently appears on figures of the god on Attic vases
of that period. Dionysos has short hair for the first time on the
Parthenon frieze.<a id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">497</a> Furtwaengler has shown that Pheidias did not
invent the short bound-up hair for goddess types, as we see it in
the <i>Lemnian Athena</i>, but that he borrowed it from works already
in existence.<a id="FNanchor_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">498</a> Though the style was unknown in the archaic period,
it appears on helmeted heads of Athena of the early fifth century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> showing Peloponnesian style—on coins, statuettes, reliefs, etc.
It appears in Attic art exclusively on bareheaded types of Athena
of the period just prior to that of the <i>Lemnia</i>.</p>

<p>Bulle<a id="FNanchor_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">499</a> has gone carefully into the technique of the hair by different
Greek artists. In archaic times this was “<i>ein, man darf sagen, unmoegliches
Problem</i>.” The primitive means at the disposal of the
early artist made it impossible to render the hair naturally and hence
it was conventionalized. Two styles arose in archaic times, which
endured with modifications all through Greek art. The one was
the pictorial (<i>malerisch</i>), where only the general appearance of the
hair was represented, the merest necessary plastic form being added.<a id="FNanchor_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">500</a>
Painting here helped the shortcomings of the sculptor to some extent.
The second style was the plastic (<i>plastisch</i>), where individual locks
were attempted. The plastic use of light and shade made the use of
color now less necessary. Such examples as the <i>Korai</i> of the Akropolis
Museum and the Rampin head in the Louvre show the difficulty which
the early artist encountered in representing hair plastically. In the
Rampin head<a id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">501</a> we see examples of three sorts of plastic hair treatment:
the pearl-string (<i>Perlschnuerre</i>) on the neck, grained hair (<i>Koerner</i>) in
the beard, and snail-volutes (<i>geperlte Schnecken</i>) on the forehead. None
of the three seems to belong integrally to the head, but each appears
to have been pasted on. The pearl-string fashion was first used in
the soft <i>poros</i> stone and was only later successfully transferred to
marble. During the severe style of Greek sculpture, both fashions,
pictorial and plastic, were used, as we see them in the pediment
groups from the temple of Zeus at Olympia. In the period of Pheidias
the plastic treatment was used almost exclusively, as we see in
the <i>Lemnian Athena</i>. In the next century impressionism came in,
though the plastic treatment still continued, for we see it in the
bronze work of Lysippos and the marble work of Praxiteles. The
old pictorial treatment was revived again in the later Hellenistic age.</p>

<h3>ICONIC AND ANICONIC STATUES.</h3>

<p>In a well-known passage Pliny says that “the ancients did not make
any statue of individuals unless they deserved immortality by some
distinction, originally by a victory at some sacred games, especially
those of Olympia, where it was the custom to dedicate statues of all
those who had conquered, and portrait statues if they had conquered
three times. These are called iconic.”<a id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">502</a> Many solutions of this passage
have been offered. Older commentators, as Hirt and Visconti,<a id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">503</a>
interpreted Pliny’s word <i>iconicas</i> as life-size statues. Scherer, however,
easily refuted this idea and showed that the adjective εἰκονικός,
though ambiguous in its meaning, had nothing to do with size, but
referred rather to an individual as opposed to a typical sense in relation
to statuary. In his explanation he referred to the words of Lessing
in the <i>Laokoön</i>: <i>es ist das Ideal eines gewissen Menschen, nicht das
Ideal eines Menschen ueberhaupt</i>.<a id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">504</a> Nowadays all scholars agree that
Pliny’s word refers to portrait statues.<a id="FNanchor_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">505</a> However, Pliny’s dictum
about the right of setting up portrait statues is certainly open to doubt.<a id="FNanchor_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">506</a>
It can not have been true of monuments erected before the fourth
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, when portrait statues were rare. Portraiture was a
form of realism and was a product of the later period of Greek art—especially
after the time of Lysippos. In the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>
we find one well-attested exception to Pliny’s rule. The discovered
inscription from the base of a monument erected to the horse-racer
Xenombrotos of Cos,<a id="FNanchor_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">507</a> reads (fifth line): τοῖ[ος], ὁποῖο[ν] ὁ[ρ]ᾷς Ξεινόμβροτο[ς].
These words indubitably point to a portrait statue. However,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
neither the recovered epigram nor Pausanias indicates anything about
this victor being a τρισολυμπιονίκης, and consequently he appears
not to have merited a portrait statue.<a id="FNanchor_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">508</a> Pliny’s statement can be
explained in many ways: it may be apocryphal, or different usages
may have fitted different periods; or the rule may have held good only
for gymnic victors and not for equestrian ones, which, being strictly
votive in character, may not have been restricted to its operation.<a id="FNanchor_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">509</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Portrait Statues.</span></h4>

<p>Pausanias mentions the monuments of several victors at Olympia
who were entitled to portrait statues on the strength of Pliny’s rule,
though we have no indication that they were so honored. Thus he
mentions the statues of Dikon,<a id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">510</a> Sostratos,<a id="FNanchor_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">511</a> Philinos,<a id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">512</a> and Gorgos.<a id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">513</a>
The early fifth-century boxer Euthymos<a id="FNanchor_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">514</a> also won three victories, but
at a time before we should expect a portrait statue. The Periegete also
mentions several victors who won three or more times, though he does
not say that they had any statues, portrait or otherwise.<a id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">515</a> Percy Gardner<a id="FNanchor_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">516</a>
has shown how erroneous is the prevailing view that the Greeks
neglected portraiture in their art and left it for the Romans to develop.
He shows that Greek artists of the third and second centuries <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>
left a great many portraits of the highest artistic value and that portraits
of Romans before the time of Augustus, and the best Roman
examples during the Empire, were made by Greek sculptors. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
number of Greek portraits in our museums, especially in Rome, is
very great.<a id="FNanchor_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">517</a> From archaic times down to the middle of the fifth century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> we should not expect portraiture. In the earlier period,
therefore, it is difficult to distinguish between statues of gods and those
of men. In the great period of Greek art, from the time of Perikles
on to that of Alexander, the general tendency of Greek sculpture was
so ideal that portraits, when they existed, seem impersonal. The
later copyists of portraits also idealized them. Thus Pliny, in speaking
of Kresilas’ portrait of Perikles, says that this artist <i>nobiles viros
nobiliores fecit</i>—in other words, that he idealized them.<a id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">518</a> The portraits
of Alexander were especially idealized. In the first half of the
fourth century we first hear of realistic portraiture. Thus Demetrios,
who flourished 380–360 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>,<a id="FNanchor_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">519</a> made a “very beautiful” statue of a
Corinthian general named Pelichos, which Lucian<a id="FNanchor_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">520</a> says had a fat
belly, bald head, hair floating in the wind, and prominent veins, “like
the man himself.”<a id="FNanchor_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">521</a> Except for the hair this description by the satirist
seems to have been correct. At the end of the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> anatomical
detail began to be shown in sculpture. Largely under the influence
of Lysippos, the personality of victors began to be emphasized
in figure and face in a very realistic way. We can distinguish between
such portraits of victors before and after the time of Lysippos.<a id="FNanchor_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">522</a> Pliny<a id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">523</a>
says that Lysistratos, the brother of Lysippos, was the first to obtain
portraits by making a plaster mould on the features and so to render
likenesses exactly, as “previous artists had only tried to make them as
beautiful as possible.” In any case, by the time of Lysippos realistic
portraiture began to be emphasized. We see it at Olympia in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
later bronze pancratiast’s head found there (Fig. <a href="#f61">61</a>, A and B), and
in a still more revolting style in the <i>Seated Boxer</i> of the Museo delle
Terme (Pl. <a href="#p16">16</a>, and Fig. <a href="#f27">27</a>).</p>

<p>The reason why the privilege of erecting portrait statues was given
so seldom to Olympic victors was probably not because it was a highly
esteemed honor. The real reason seems to have been that portraiture,
with its tendency to realism, subordinated beauty to that realism and
so conflicted with the Greek artistic ideal. The Thebans had a law
which forbade caricature and commanded artists to make their
statues more beautiful than the models. The Greeks worshiped
beauty and hated ugliness. Many games in Greece were held in honor
of personal beauty. Thus a contest of manly beauty among old men
(ἀγὼν εὐανδρίας) was a part of the Panathenaic games at Athens.<a id="FNanchor_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">524</a>
A contest of beauty among women, originating in the time of
Kypselos, king of Arkadia, was kept up until the time of Athenæus.<a id="FNanchor_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">525</a>
We hear of contests of beauty in Elis, at which three prizes were
given,<a id="FNanchor_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">526</a> and of similar ones on the islands of Tenedos and Lesbos.<a id="FNanchor_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">527</a>
The Crotonian Philippos, who won at Olympia in an unknown contest
about 520 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, was honored after his death by the people of Egesta
with a <i>heroön</i> and sacrifices because of his beauty.<a id="FNanchor_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">528</a> At Tanagra, in
Bœotia, the most beautiful ephebe was chosen to carry a ram on his
shoulders around the city wall at the festival of Hermes Kriophoros.<a id="FNanchor_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">529</a>
At Aigion in Achaia the most beautiful boy was anciently chosen to
be priest of Zeus.<a id="FNanchor_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">530</a> The most beautiful youths among the Spartans
and Cretans dedicated offerings to Eros before battle.<a id="FNanchor_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">531</a> These and
similar examples show the Greek feeling for beauty. The representation
of passion and violence was foreign to the spirit of the best Greek
art; it was rather the “quiet grandeur” (<i>Stille Groesse</i>) or “repose,”
of which Winckelmann made so much, that was characteristic of that
art. In Homer both men and gods, when wounded, shriek. Philoktetes,
in the drama of Sophokles, wails throughout a whole act, when
suffering from a gangrened foot. With the poets Zeus casts his thunderbolt
in anger, but Pheidias has him hold it quietly in his hand. So we
can see why portrait statues were rare at Olympia, where the representation
of manly beauty and vigor was the rule. They were ruled out,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
not because of their increasing the honor accorded to the victor, but
rather because they honored his egotism.<a id="FNanchor_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">532</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Aniconic Statues.</span></h4>

<p>Accordingly, since only victors who had won three or more contests
at Olympia could set up iconic statues, the great majority of statues
there represented some ideal type of common applicability, in which
there was no attempt to show the individual features of this or that
victor, but rather the typical athlete of muscular build. The older
statues were merely variations of a few types which were held to be
appropriate to the purpose. In process of time these few types in their
treatment of details gradually approached truth to nature; this was
especially characteristic of the Peloponnesian schools, which adopted
the <i>Doryphoros</i> of Polykleitos as their norm of proportions. Statues
of victors were the stock subject of the closely related schools of Argos
and Sikyon.<a id="FNanchor_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">533</a> Doubtless, as E. A. Gardner says,<a id="FNanchor_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">534</a> there existed at
Olympia itself a school of subordinate artists, who filled the regular
demand for victor statues. However, some of these statues, especially
those of the fifth and fourth centuries <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, as we see them in originals
and in Roman copies, and read the æsthetic judgments of them in
Greek writers, were real works of art.</p>

<h3>ÆSTHETIC JUDGMENTS OF CLASSICAL WRITERS.</h3>

<p>The literary evidence for Greek sculpture is, for the most part, very
unsatisfactory. Though classical writers were uncritical and not fond
of analysis, still they have left us some useful opinions about works of
sculpture and painting. The history and criticism of sculpture began
in Greece, in the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, with the Peripatetics. Aristotle,
whose observations on painting and sculpture were slight, did not despise
the “mimetic” arts as did the Socrates of Plato.<a id="FNanchor_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">535</a> In the <i>Rhetoric</i><a id="FNanchor_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">536</a>
he speaks of the beautiful bodies of youths who trained as pentathletes,
since the varied exercises of the pentathlon made them so. We have a
similar opinion expressed by Xenophon in what is, perhaps, the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
interesting passage in Greek literature on criticism of art.<a id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">537</a> He has
Sokrates go to the sculptor Kleito and compliment him on his power of
representing different physical types produced by various contests,
noting differences between statues of runners and wrestlers and between
those of boxers and pancratiasts. When asked how he makes statues
lifelike, Kleito has no answer, and the philosopher says it is by the imitation
of real men, <i>i. e.</i>, nature. He adds: “Must you not then imitate
the threatening eyes of those who are fighting and the triumphant
expression of those who are victorious?” Though some have thought
that these words refer to portrait statues, which were spoken of as a
matter of course at the beginning of the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, it is more
reasonable to suspect that Sokrates was speaking of the older sculptors—for
we may recognize Polykleitos in Kleito<a id="FNanchor_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">538</a>—and consequently that
he is not referring to portraiture. In the <i>Symposium</i> of Xenophon<a id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">539</a>
Sokrates also complains that the long-distance runners (δολιχοδρόμοι)
have thick legs and narrow shoulders, while boxers have broad shoulders
and small legs, and he therefore recommends dancing as a better
exercise than athletics. As such differences in physique occur in vase-paintings
of the date, but not in statuary, the philosopher seems to be
speaking of athletics and not of sculpture. From these quotations
of Aristotle and Xenophon, we gather that the all-round development
of the pentathlon made beautiful athletes, and this beauty must have
been carried over into their statues. It is essentially the young man’s
contest,<a id="FNanchor_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">540</a> and some of the pentathlete victors at Olympia and elsewhere
were noted for their strength in after life. Thus Ikkos of Tarentum,
who won at Olympia in Ol. 76 (&#8239;=&#8239;476 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), was the best teacher of
gymnastics of his day.<a id="FNanchor_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">541</a> Gorgos of Elis was the only athlete to win
the pentathlon four times at Olympia, besides winning in two running
races.<a id="FNanchor_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">542</a> Another Elean, Stomios, who won three prizes at Olympia and
Nemea, later became a leader of cavalry and beat his enemy in single
combat.<a id="FNanchor_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">543</a> The Argive Eurybates, victor in the pentathlon at Nemea,
was very strong, and later, in a battle with the Aeginetans, killed three
opponents in single combats, but succumbed to the fourth.<a id="FNanchor_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">544</a> The Spar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>tans
and Krotonians seem to have been the best pentathletes.<a id="FNanchor_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">545</a> Noted
sculptors made statues of these athletes.<a id="FNanchor_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">546</a> Plato, in the <i>de Leg.</i>,<a id="FNanchor_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">547</a> has the
Athenian stranger praise Egyptian art because of its stationary character.
This bespeaks but little artistic insight for the philosopher,
though he was surrounded by the wonderful artistic creations of the end
of the great fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> The later classical writers were fond of
expressing criticisms of art. Thus Pasiteles, a Greek sculptor living in
Rome in the first century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, wrote five books on celebrated works of
art throughout the world.<a id="FNanchor_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">548</a> The opinions on art of the Roman Varro
appear in the pages of Pliny.<a id="FNanchor_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">549</a> Of all the ancient critics, Cicero was
perhaps the most superficial. In a passage in the <i>Brutus</i><a id="FNanchor_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">550</a> he gives
us his judgment of several sculptors. He finds the works of Kanachos
too rigid to imitate nature truthfully, while those of Kalamis, though
softer than those of Kanachos, are hard; Myron, though not completely
faithful to nature, produced beautiful works and Polykleitos was
quite perfect. The most trustworthy critic of sculpture in antiquity,
on the other hand, was certainly Lucian, as we see from many of his
utterances, especially from his account of an ideal statue, which combined
the highest excellences of several noted sculptures.<a id="FNanchor_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">551</a> His criticism
of Hegias, Kritios, and Nesiotes, to the effect that their works were
“concise, sinewy, hard, and exactly strained in their lines,” might have
been made in the presence of the group of the <i>Tyrannicides</i> (Fig. <a href="#f32">32</a>).<a id="FNanchor_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">552</a>
Unfortunately he touches the subject only casually, though he might
have written a fine history of Greek art. We must also refer to two
other imperial writers, the elder Pliny and Pausanias. Pliny’s abstracts
on art, though our chief ancient literary authority on Greek sculpture
and painting, are neither critical nor trustworthy. A careful analysis
of his chapters shows that he was a borrower many times removed,
though he seldom acknowledged it. This is excusable when we consider
the custom of literary borrowing in antiquity and also the fact
that his chapters on art form merely an appendix to his <i>Natural History</i>,
being joined on to it by a very artificial bond, for his abstract on
bronze statuary (Bk. XXXIV) is brought in merely to complete his
account of the metals. His knowledge of the older periods of Greek<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
art is small and his bias in favor of the two Sikyonian sculptors
Lysippos and Xenokrates is very evident. His worst mistakes are in
chronology. He puts Pythagoras after Myron, and both after Polykleitos,
while Hagelaïdas, who is made the teacher of Myron and
Polykleitos, lives on to the beginning of the Peloponnesian war.
His real criticism of sculpture is seen in his dictum of the <i>Laokoön</i>
group, that it is a “work superior to all the pictures and bronzes of
the world.”<a id="FNanchor_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">553</a> Our debt to Pausanias, especially for our knowledge
of the victor monuments at Olympia, is immense. This debt may
be gauged by the fact that he mentions in his work many times more
statues than any other writer and that a large portion of the <i>Schriftquellen</i>
of Overbeck is concerned with him. However, he shows little
real understanding for art. His interest in statues is confined almost
entirely to those which are noted for their antiquity or sanctity, and
his account of them is usually the pivot around which he spins religious
or mythological stories. Throughout his work his chief interest is
religious; his interest in art for its own sake is very small. He devotes
many pages to the throne of Zeus at Olympia, and describes the temple
sculptures merely because the statue of Zeus is within. His detailed
account of the athlete statues in the Altis is made chiefly because of
his religious and antiquarian interest. Though imitating the style of
Herodotos, he does it badly, so that his book is without much charm.
In concluding this rough estimate of the ancient criticism of art, we
might mention the fragmentary information to be gathered from many
other writers, Dio Chrysostom, Quintilian,<a id="FNanchor_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">554</a> Plutarch, and others,
whose names occur frequently in the footnotes. All such references
to works of art in ancient writers are conveniently collected in the
great compilation of Overbeck so often quoted.<a id="FNanchor_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">555</a></p>

<p>As for æsthetic judgments of the statues of victors at Olympia we
have a few direct hints from different writers. The epigram from the
base of the statue of the boy wrestler Theognetos by Ptolichos of
Aegina reads in part: Κάλλιστον μὲν ἰδεῖν, ἀθλεῖν δ’ οὐ χείρονα μόρ[φης].<a id="FNanchor_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">556</a>
Pliny says of the sculptor Mikon, who made the statue of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
Athenian pancratiast Kallias: <i>Micon athletis spectatur</i>.<a id="FNanchor_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">557</a> The same
writer says of the horses of Kalamis: <i>equis sine aemulo expressis</i>.<a id="FNanchor_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">558</a>
Kalamis with Onatas of Aegina made a chariot-group for the Syracusan
king Hiero.<a id="FNanchor_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">559</a> Pausanias, in mentioning the statue of the boxer
Euthymos by Pythagoras, says that it is καὶ θέας ἐς τὰ μάλιστα ἄξιος.<a id="FNanchor_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">560</a>
In mentioning the statue by the same sculptor of the wrestler Leontiskos,
he says: εἴπερ τις καὶ ἄλλος ἀγαθὸς τὰ ἐς πλαστικήν.<a id="FNanchor_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">561</a> Of the
Argive sculptor Naukydes he says, when speaking of the statue of the
wrestler Cheimon, that it is among the finest works of that artist.<a id="FNanchor_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">562</a>
In another passage, in which he describes the dedication of Phormis
at Olympia, he speaks of an ugly horse, which, besides being smaller
than other sculptured horses in the Altis, has “its tail cut off, and this
makes it still uglier.”<a id="FNanchor_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">563</a> However, here he is not so much interested in
its lack of beauty as in the curious fact which he adds, that despite
its ugliness this bronze mare attracted stallions.</p>

<h3>GREEK ORIGINALS OF VICTOR STATUES.</h3>


<div class="figcenter500"><p class="right">PLATE 3</p><a id="p3"></a>
<img src="images/i_fp062.jpg" width="500" height="755" alt="Bronze Head of an Olympic Victor." />
<div class="caption">Bronze Head of an Olympic Victor. Glyptothek, Munich.</div>
</div>

<p>We are not, however, dependent upon such meagre scraps of evidence
from classical writers, nor upon contested Roman copies,<a id="FNanchor_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">564</a> for an idea
of the workmanship of some of the Olympic victor statues. We can
judge it in no uncertain way by the few originals found at Olympia
and by others which are to be found in European museums. As
an example of the former we have only to recall the life-size bronze
bearded head of a boxer or pancratiast of the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>,
which is now in the National Museum at Athens<a id="FNanchor_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">565</a> (Fig. <a href="#f61">61</a>, A and B).
Its only decoration, an olive crown whose leaves have disappeared,
proves it to be from the statue of a victor, and its wild locks, brutal
look, flattened nose, and wide mouth represent a naturalistic study of
the utmost strength and fineness, which could only have been produced
after the time of Lysippos. We shall discuss this remarkable
head more fully in Chapter IV. As examples of original victor
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
monuments in European museums we shall mention three. The bronze
head of a boxer in the Glyptothek at Munich (Pl. <a href="#p3">3</a>) is an original of
the first rank.<a id="FNanchor_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">566</a> It is from a statue found near Naples in 1730, which
was later destroyed, and it probably represents the head of a boy of
about twelve years, a victor in boxing, to judge from the victor band
in the hair and the fact that the visible part of the right ear is swollen.
Like the head of the <i>Diadoumenos</i> of Polykleitos (Figs. 28, 29) this beautiful
head exemplifies fully the “ethical grace” or modesty<a id="FNanchor_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">567</a> so characteristic
of the best Greek art, and it certainly merits Furtwaengler’s praise
of being the “most precious treasure of the Glyptothek.”<a id="FNanchor_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">568</a> Another
head, found in Beneventum and now in the Louvre (Fig. <a href="#f3">3</a>)<a id="FNanchor_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">569</a> is a splendid
Greek original of the last decade of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, and, as Mrs.
Strong says, should arouse in us a sense of what precious relics may still
lie hidden in our museums.<a id="FNanchor_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">570</a> The victor fillet in the hair, consisting of
two sprays of what seems to be wild olive (remnants of which appear
in front), shows that the statue must once have ornamented the Altis.
Like the one in Munich, this head shows Polykleitan inspiration tempered
by Attic influence.<a id="FNanchor_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">571</a> Lastly, the bronze head of a youth from the
<i>tablinum</i>, of the so-called villa of the Pisos at Herculaneum, now in
Naples,<a id="FNanchor_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">572</a> is, to judge from its technique, an excellent original Greek
work (Fig. <a href="#f4">4</a>). Here again the hair fillet shows it is from a victor statue,
though its provenience from Olympia can not be established.</p>

</div>

<p>Such beautiful works of art as these last show the influence which
the great athletic festivals, and especially the Olympian, exerted on the
development of Greek sculpture. In the gymnastic training carried
on in the gymnasium and palæstra, which culminated in these festivals,
the Greek sculptor found an unrivaled opportunity to study the
naked human figure in its best muscular development and in every
pose. In fact, we may say with Furtwaengler that without athletics
Greek art would be inconceivable.<a id="FNanchor_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">573</a> To quote from another work of
the same scholar:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The gymnastically trained bodies of these slim boys and youths and vigorous
men are evidence of the ennobling effect of athletics. Presented in
complete nudity they are not faithful portraits from life, but motives or models
from the palæstra transformed and exalted to the highest ideal of physical
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>beauty and strength. They are the most splendid human beings that the
art of any period has created.”<a id="FNanchor_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">574</a></p></blockquote>

<h3>CANONS OF PROPORTION.</h3>

<p>In attempting to identify a given statue as the copy of a work by this
or that master, certain well-known canons of proportion, which were
taught and practiced by various Greek sculptors and schools, must be
taken into consideration.</p>

<p>Greek art may, like Greek philosophy and poetry, be summarized
under the names of three qualities which constantly occur in classical
literature—συμμετρία, εὐρυθμία or ῥυθμός, and ἀναλογία.<a id="FNanchor_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">575</a> Symmetry
may be defined as “that technical regard for the placing of the parts to
the best advantage,” the symmetrical arrangement of the parts of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
a statue or group of figures.<a id="FNanchor_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">576</a> Rhythm, following Vitruvius,<a id="FNanchor_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">577</a> is that
<i>tertium quid</i> which is indispensable to true art. Analogy (Latin <i>proportio</i>)<a id="FNanchor_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">578</a>
refers to the measured ratio of part to part in any given work
of art, whether in architecture, painting, or sculpture. Most scholars
nowadays interpret symmetry and analogy as the same thing. Pliny<a id="FNanchor_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">579</a>
says that <i>symmetria</i> has no Latin equivalent, and in several passages<a id="FNanchor_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">580</a>
keeps the Greek word, as does Vitruvius. Here Otto Jahn rightly
says <i>proportio</i> or <i>commensus</i> would have adequately translated it.<a id="FNanchor_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">581</a>
P. Gardner explains the word properly as “the proportion of one part
of the body as measured against another.”<a id="FNanchor_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">582</a> Brunn held that, as symmetry
was the relation of part to part in a statue at rest, rhythm expressed
this relationship in one represented in motion.<a id="FNanchor_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">583</a> The simplest
illustration of rhythm is seen in walking: when the right foot is advanced
the left arm swings out in rhythm, and so the balance of the body is
kept. Rhythm, therefore, has to do with balance in motion, and may
refer equally to cadence in poetry and music and to movement in
sculpture. An excellent example in sculpture is afforded by Myron’s
<i>Diskobolos</i> (Pls. 21, 22, and Figs. 34, 35), while the balancing of figures
on many Greek reliefs—especially on Attic funerary stelæ—illustrates
symmetry (<i>cf.</i> Fig. <a href="#f75">75</a>). Pliny characterizes certain artists by their
success in effecting symmetry and rhythm. Thus Myron surpassed
Polykleitos in being more rhythmic and in paying more attention
to symmetry.<a id="FNanchor_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">584</a> He says that Lysippos most diligently preserved
symmetry by bringing unthought-of innovations into the square canon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>of earlier artists.<a id="FNanchor_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">585</a> Parrhasios was the first to introduce symmetry into
painting.<a id="FNanchor_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">586</a> Diogenes Laertios says that the sculptor Pythagoras was
the first to aim at rhythm as well as symmetry.<a id="FNanchor_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">587</a> In all such passages
it is clear that canons of proportion are meant.</p>

<p>The doctrine of human proportions is very ancient, originating
in Egyptian art.<a id="FNanchor_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">588</a> It appears early in Greek architecture in the
proportions of columns and other members of a temple,<a id="FNanchor_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">589</a> and it
was soon transferred to sculpture. As Greek sculpture evolved on
traditional lines,<a id="FNanchor_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">590</a> we should assume that it paid attention to the
doctrine of proportions in the human figure, based on numerical
ratios, and that such a doctrine would vary from age to age in the
various schools of sculpture. Such an assumption is borne out by
both literary and archæological evidence. Toward the end of Hellenism
many writers refer to just such a measured basis of proportion in
Greek art.<a id="FNanchor_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">591</a> Archæologists have shown by the careful study of multitudes
of statues that such proportions exist in Greek sculpture. Thus
A. Kalkmann<a id="FNanchor_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">592</a> has proved that there are sets of ratios in the treatment
of the face used by successive schools of sculpture, which were canonical,
whether formulated or not. G. Fritsch<a id="FNanchor_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">593</a> has done for the whole body<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
what Kalkman has done for the face. In fact, anthropometry in
relation to Greek sculpture has now become an exact science.<a id="FNanchor_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">594</a></p>

<p>The greatest artists—architects, painters, and sculptors—of all times
have taught and practised the doctrine that certain proportions are
beautiful, <i>e. g.</i>, the proportion of the height of the head or the length
of the foot to the whole body, or the length of parts of the head or body
to other parts. In modern times we have only to mention such names
as those of da Vinci, Duerer, Raphael Mengs, and Flaxman.<a id="FNanchor_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">595</a> In
Greek days there were many artists who formulated such canons of
proportions. Greek sculptors followed ratios of proportions so closely
that we have statues of various schools, which are distinguished by
fixed proportions of parts, such as the Old Attic, Old Argive, Polykleitan,
Argive-Sikyonian or Lysippan, etc. Some of these schools
used the foot as the common measure, while others used the palm,
finger, or other member.<a id="FNanchor_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">596</a> The earliest works on Greek art were treatises,
now lost, by artists in which they worked out their theories of the
principles underlying the proportions of the human figure.<a id="FNanchor_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">597</a> We shall
briefly consider a few of these canons, together with the usual pose of
body which conformed with them. The earliest Peloponnesian canon,
which we can analyze, was that followed by Hagelaïdas of Argos and his
school, a canon which was still used in the Polykleitan circle. Here
the weight of the body rested upon the left leg, while the right one was
slightly bent at the knee, its foot resting flat on the ground; the right
arm hung by the side and the left was usually in action, and the head
was slightly inclined to the left side; the shoulders were extraordinarily
broad in comparison with the hips, the right one being slightly raised.
These qualities produced a short stocky figure, firmly placed.<a id="FNanchor_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">598</a> In
the middle of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, Polykleitos worked out a theory of
proportions in the form of a commentary on his famous statue known
as the <i>Doryphoros</i>. This canon was characterized by squareness and
massiveness of build. The weight of the body generally rested on the
right foot, while the left was drawn back, its foot touching the ground
with the ball only. Sometimes this pose was reversed, the left foot
carrying the body-weight, as in the three bases of statues by the master
found at Olympia (<i>i. e.</i>, those of the athletes Pythokles, Aristion, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Kyniskos, to be discussed later), and in the works of some of his pupils,
notably in those of Naukydes, Daidalos, and Kleon.<a id="FNanchor_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">599</a> Euphranor,
who flourished, according to Pliny, in Ol. 104 (&#8239;=&#8239;364–361 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), and
wrote works on symmetry and color, was the “first” to master the
theory of symmetry.<a id="FNanchor_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">600</a> Pliny, however, found his bodies too slender
and his heads and limbs too large, a criticism of his painting which
must have been equally applicable to his sculpture. His canon did
not make much headway, as the majority of sculptors in his century
were still under the domination of the canon of Polykleitos. It was
left for Lysippos, in the second half of the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, finally
to break this domination of the great fifth-century sculptor. Pliny
quotes Douris as saying that he was the pupil of no man, and that
because of the advice of the painter Eupompos he was a follower of
nature—which appears to be a cut at the schools which mechanically
followed fixed rules.<a id="FNanchor_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">601</a> His statues had smaller heads, and more slender
and less fleshy limbs, than those of his predecessors, in order that the
apparent height of the figure might be increased.<a id="FNanchor_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">602</a> While Polykleitos
made his heads one-seventh of the total height of the statue, Lysippos
made his one-eighth—if this change may be seen in the <i>Apoxyomenos</i>
(Pl. <a href="#p28">28</a>), which is certainly a work of his school, if not of the master
himself. Pliny further records his saying that while his predecessors
represented men as they were, Lysippos represented them as they
appeared to be. This means that Pliny regarded him as the first
impressionistic artist.<a id="FNanchor_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">603</a> Pliny mentions other artists who wrote on art,
and it is probable that theories of proportions formed the main element
of such works.<a id="FNanchor_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">604</a></p>

<p>The best example of symmetry, <i>i. e.</i>, of the ratio of proportions, in
Greek sculpture is afforded by the <i>Doryphoros</i> of Polykleitos, which
Pliny says was called the <i>Canon</i>, and he adds that this sculptor was
the only one who embodied his art in a single work.<a id="FNanchor_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">605</a> The identity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
of the canon with this statue seems to be attested by the anecdote told
of Lysippos that the <i>Doryphoros</i> was his master,<a id="FNanchor_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">606</a> and by Quintilian’s
statement that sculptors took it as a model.<a id="FNanchor_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">607</a> The best-preserved
copy of the <i>Doryphoros</i>, despite its rather lifeless character, is the
one discovered in Pompeii and now in Naples (Pl. <a href="#p4">4</a>).<a id="FNanchor_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">608</a> As other
late Roman copies do not conform to the identical proportions of this
copy, it is perhaps difficult to say exactly what the canon of Polykleitos
was. Possibly the original, if it had been preserved, would also
strike us as somewhat lifeless; but we must remember that the statue
was made merely to illustrate a theory of proportions. The dimensions
of the Naples statue are known from very careful measurements
and the proportions agree with those given in the description
by Galen to be mentioned. It is almost exactly 2 meters, or 6 feet 8
inches, high.<a id="FNanchor_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">609</a> The length of the foot is 0.33 meter, or one-sixth of the
total height, while the length of the face is 0.20 meter, or one-tenth of
the height. E. Guillaume<a id="FNanchor_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">610</a> has made a careful analysis of it in reference
to Galen’s<a id="FNanchor_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">611</a> statement that Chrysippos found beauty in the proportion
of the parts, “of finger to finger, and of all the fingers to the
palm and wrist, and of these to the forearm, and of the forearm to
the upper arm, and of all the parts to each other, as they are set forth
in the canon of Polykleitos.” He has found that the palm, <i>i. e.</i>, the
breadth of the hand at the base of the fingers, is a common measure
of the proportions of the body. This palm is one-third the length of
the foot, one-sixth that of the lower leg, one-sixth that of the thigh,
and one-sixth that of the distance from the navel to the ear, etc.
Such a remarkable correspondence in measurements would seem to
show, if we had no other proofs, that the Naples statue reproduces
the canon of Polykleitos more closely than any other.</p>

<div class="caption">Statue of the <i>Doryphoros</i>, after Polykleitos. Museum of Naples.</div>
</div>

<p>A good example of asymmetry is afforded by the so-called <i>Spinario</i>
of the Palazzo dei Conservatori in Rome<a id="FNanchor_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">612</a> (Fig. <a href="#f40">40</a>). This justly
prized statue shows more asymmetry, perhaps, than any other down to
its date—just before the middle of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> Though its
composition is such that there is no vantage-point from which it forms
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
a harmonious whole, still its effect on the beholder is far from displeasing.
Such a creation shows that a Greek artist, even without
paying attention to the symmetrical arrangement of parts, could at
times produce an attractive piece of sculpture.</p>

<h3>ASSIMILATION OF OLYMPIC VICTOR STATUES TO TYPES
OF GODS AND HEROES.</h3>

<p>Since Greek art in the main was idealistic, we should not be surprised
to discover in athletic sculpture a tendency toward assimilating
victor statues to well-known types of gods or heroes, especially to those
of Hermes, Apollo, and Herakles, who presided over contests or gymnasia
and palæstræ. This phenomenon is only a further example of the
extraordinary, almost superhuman, honors which were paid to victors
at the great games. In the absence of sufficient means of identification,
it is often very difficult to distinguish with certainty between
statues of victors and those of the gods and heroes to whom they were
assimilated. This difficulty, as we shall see, is especially observable
in the case of Herakles. Even later antiquity recognized that statues
of athletes were sometimes confused with those of heroes, just as those
of heroes were with those of gods, as we learn from a passage in Dio
Chrysostom’s oration on Rhodian affairs.<a id="FNanchor_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">613</a> This difficulty is one of
the most perplexing problems that still face the student of Greek
sculpture.</p>

<p>It was not an uncommon custom in Greece to heroize in this way an
ordinary dead man.<a id="FNanchor_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">614</a> One of the most striking instances of this custom
is afforded by the so-called <i>Hermes of Andros</i>, a statue found in a
grave-chamber on the island in 1833 and now in Athens<a id="FNanchor_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">615</a> (Pl. <a href="#p5">5</a>). It
has been a matter of dispute among archæologists whether this statue
represents the god Hermes or a mortal in his guise. Although Staïs<a id="FNanchor_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">616</a>
looks on it as <i>un problème peut-être à jamais insoluble</i>, there seems
little reason for doubting that it represents a defunct mortal. Its place
of finding in a tomb along with the statue of a woman of the Muse type,
which probably represents the man’s consort,<a id="FNanchor_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">617</a> the presence of a snake
on the adjacent tree trunk, the absence of sandals and kerykeion, and
the portrait—like features—all point to the conclusion that a man and
not a god is represented. The downcast, almost melancholy, look<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
seems also to make it a funereal figure. The powerful proportions
of a perfectly developed athlete, displaying no tendency toward the
representation of brute force, show that the man is idealized into
the type of Hermes, the god of the palæstra, rather than into the
light-winged messenger of Olympos. The <i>Belvedere Hermes</i> of the
Vatican,<a id="FNanchor_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">618</a> and a better one known as the <i>Farnese Hermes</i> of the British
Museum,<a id="FNanchor_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">619</a> are noteworthy replicas of the type. The latter carries the
kerykeion in the left hand and wears sandals, with a small chlamys over
the left arm and shoulder. These attributes show that Hermes was
intended in this copy. Probably the original of these various replicas,
a work dating from the end of the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, and ascribed to
Praxiteles or his school in consequence of similarity in pose and build
of body and head to the <i>Hermes</i> of Olympia, was intended to represent
Hermes. In the one from Andros, at least, the copyist intended to
heroize a mortal under the type of the god. Similarly, the statue known
as the <i>Standing Hermes</i> in the Galleria delle Statue of the Vatican,<a id="FNanchor_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">620</a> which
has the kerykeion and chlamys, whether its original represented Hermes,
hero or mortal, has been made by the copyist to represent Hermes,
the god of athletics, as the late attribute of wings in the hair proves.
Other examples of dead men represented as Hermes are not uncommon.
Thus a Greek grave-stele in Verona<a id="FNanchor_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">621</a> shows the dead portrayed as a
winged Hermes, and a similar figure appears on a stele from Tanagra.<a id="FNanchor_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">622</a>
The so-called <i>Commodus</i> in Mantua<a id="FNanchor_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">623</a> is interpreted by Conze and
Duetschke as the figure of a dead youth in Hermes’ guise. But this
custom of representing defunct mortals as gods was less common in
Roman art. The bust of a dead youth on a Roman grave-stone in
Turin,<a id="FNanchor_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">624</a> set up in honor of L. Mussius, is a good example. Here the
cock, sheep, and kerykeion, symbols of the god, show that the youth
is represented as Hermes.</p>

<p>Not only dead men, however, were heroized in this manner. It
was not an uncommon practice in later Greece for living men, especially
princes, to have their statues assimilated to types of gods and heroes,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>a practice which was very common in imperial Rome.<a id="FNanchor_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">625</a> Thus many
of the Hellenistic princes were pleased to have their statues assimilated
to those of the heroic Alexander. One of the best examples of
this process is furnished by the original

bronze portrait statue of such a
prince, which was unearthed in Rome
in 1884 and is now in the Museo delle
Terme there (Fig. <a href="#f5">5</a>).<a id="FNanchor_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">626</a> It has been
identified as the portrait of several
kings of Macedon and elsewhere,<a id="FNanchor_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">627</a>
but the similarity of the head of the
statue to heads portrayed on Macedonian
coins is only superficial.<a id="FNanchor_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">628</a> All
that we can say is that this beautiful
work, representing the prince in
the heroic guise of a nude athlete of
about thirty years, belongs to the third
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, the epoch following Lysippos.
The sculptor, wishing to combine
the ideal with the real, appears to
have copied the motive directly from
a bronze statue by Lysippos, which
represented Alexander leaning with his
left hand high on a staff.<a id="FNanchor_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">629</a> The pose
also recalls that of the third-century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> statue of Poseidon found on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Melos and now in Athens.<a id="FNanchor_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">630</a> The free leg, body, and head modeling
correspond so nearly with the <i>Apoxyomenos</i> (Pl. <a href="#p28">28</a>) that it was at
first called a work of Lysippos, but its lack of repose<a id="FNanchor_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">631</a> shows that it
must be a continuation of the work of that sculptor by some pupil,
who wished to outdo his master in both form and expression.</p>

<p>Before discussing the subject of the assimilation of victor statues
to types of god and hero, we must make it clear that often, for certain
reasons, statues of athletes were later converted into those of gods,
and <i>vice versa</i>. Such examples of metamorphosing statues have nothing
to do with the process of assimilation under discussion. A few
examples will make this clear. An archaic bronze statuette from
Naxos,<a id="FNanchor_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">632</a> reproducing the type of the <i>Philesian Apollo</i> of Kanachos,
since it has the same position of hands as in the original, as we see
it later reproduced on coins of Miletos and in other copies,<a id="FNanchor_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">633</a> holds
an aryballos in the right hand instead of a fawn. As it is absurd to
represent Apollo with the bow in one hand and an oil-flask in the
other, it seems clear that in this statuette the copyist has converted a
well-known Apollo into an athlete by addition of an athletic attribute.
Famous statues were put to many different uses by later copyists.
Thus Furtwaengler has shown that the statue of the boy boxer Kyniskos
by Polykleitos at Olympia,<a id="FNanchor_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">634</a> which represented the athlete crowning
himself, was modified to represent various deities, heroes, etc. Thus
a copy from Eleusis of the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, because of its provenience
and the soft lines of the face, suggests a divinity, perhaps Triptolemos.<a id="FNanchor_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">635</a>
A copy of the same type in the Villa Albani (no. 222) has an
antique piece of a boar’s head on the nearby tree-stump and, consequently,
may represent Adonis or Meleager. A torso in the Museo
Torlonia (no. 22) represents Dionysos, another in the Museo delle
Terme has a mantle and caduceus and so represents Hermes, while
on coins of Commodus the same figure, with the lion’s skin and club,
represents Herakles.<a id="FNanchor_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">636</a> No ancient statue was used more extensively
as a model for other types than the famous <i>Doryphoros</i> of Polykleitos.
Furtwaengler<a id="FNanchor_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">637</a> has collected a long list of later conversions of this work
into statues both marble and bronze, statuettes, reliefs, etc., representing
Pan, Ares, Hermes, and in one case an ordinary mortal.<a id="FNanchor_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">638</a> Other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
examples of the conversion of statues will be given in our treatment of
assimilation.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Athlete Statues Assimilated to Types of Hermes.</span></h4>

<p>Hermes was one of the principal ἐναγώνιοι or ἀγώνιοι θεοί, <i>i. e.</i>,
gods who presided over contests, or who were overseers of gymnasia
and palæstræ, or were teachers of gymnastics (γυμνάσται).<a id="FNanchor_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">639</a> Greek
writers often mention these athletic gods. Thus Aischylos<a id="FNanchor_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">640</a> often uses
the term, not in the sense of ἀγοραῖοι θεοί, “the great assembled
gods,” (ἀγὼν = ἀγορά),<a id="FNanchor_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">641</a> but in the sense of gods who presided over
contests.<a id="FNanchor_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">642</a> This is evident from the fact that Zeus, Apollo, Poseidon,
and Hermes are the gods especially mentioned by Aischylos in this
sense, and the first three correspond with the Olympian and Nemean
games (Zeus), the Pythian (Apollo), and the Isthmian (Poseidon),
while Hermes is concerned in them all. Thus the epithet ἀγώνιοι,
in the <i>Agamemnon</i> of Aischylos refers to Zeus,<a id="FNanchor_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">643</a> Apollo,<a id="FNanchor_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">644</a> and Hermes.<a id="FNanchor_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">645</a>
If the word referred to the twelve greater gods, as some have thought,
other deities more important than Hermes would have been included.
Elsewhere the word ἀγώνιος always refers to contests.<a id="FNanchor_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">646</a> Hermes was
worshipped at Athens and elsewhere as a god of contests.<a id="FNanchor_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">647</a> The agonistic
character of this god is shown by the fact that statues and altars
were erected to him all over Greece.<a id="FNanchor_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">648</a> He was sometimes coupled with
Herakles as the protector of contests,<a id="FNanchor_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">649</a> and the images of the two
often stood in gymnasia.<a id="FNanchor_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">650</a> A fragmentary votive relief of the second
century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span> is inscribed with a dedication to both by a certain Horarios,
victor in torch-racing.<a id="FNanchor_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">651</a> Athenian ephebes made offerings to
Hermes,<a id="FNanchor_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">652</a> and to Hermes and Herakles in common, after their training
was over. Thus Dorykleides of Thera, a victor in boxing and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
the pankration at unknown games, dedicated a thank-offering to the
two.<a id="FNanchor_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">653</a> Hermes was early the god of youthful life and sports, especially
those of the palæstra. He is said to have founded wrestling<a id="FNanchor_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">654</a> and
inaugurated the sports of the palæstra.<a id="FNanchor_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">655</a> Pausanias mentions a
Gymnasion of Hermes at Athens<a id="FNanchor_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">656</a> and an altar of Hermes ἐναγώνιος
together with one of <i>Opportunity</i> (Καιρός) at the entrance to the
Stadion at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">657</a> He says that the people of Pheneus in Arkadia
held games in his honor called the <i>Hermaia</i>,<a id="FNanchor_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">658</a> and he records the
defeat of the god by Apollo in running.<a id="FNanchor_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">659</a> With such an athletic
record there is little wonder that the Greek sculptor would often
take his ideal of Hermes from the god of the palæstra and gymnasium,
representing him as an athletic youth harmoniously developed by
gymnastic exercises. It was but natural that a victor at Olympia or
elsewhere should wish to have his statue—which rarely could be a
portrait—conform with that athletic type.</p>

<div class="caption">Statue of the <i>Standing Diskobolos</i>, after Naukydes (?). Vatican
Museum, Rome.</div></div>

<p>An excellent instance of this tendency seems to be afforded by the
so-called <i>Standing Diskobolos</i> in the Sala della Biga of the Vatican
(Pl. <a href="#p6">6</a>),<a id="FNanchor_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">660</a> known since its discovery by Gavin Hamilton in 1792. It
represents a youth who is apparently taking position for throwing the
diskos, the weight of the body resting on the left leg, the knees slightly
bent, the feet firmly planted, and the diskos held in the left hand,
just prior to its being passed to the right. This position is one
which immediately precedes that of Myron’s great statue. The bronze
original dates from the second half of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, and has
been variously assigned to Myron by Brunn, to Alkamenes by Kekulé,
followed by Overbeck, Michaelis and Furtwaengler,<a id="FNanchor_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">661</a> and to Naukydes,
the brother and pupil of Polykleitos.<a id="FNanchor_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">662</a> The head of the Vatican statue
shows no trace of Peloponnesian art, but rather resembles Attic types
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>of the end of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> However, as we shall see, this head
does not appear to belong to the statue. Among the works of Alkamenes
Pliny mentions a bronze pentathlete,<a id="FNanchor_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">663</a> called the <i>Enkrinomenos</i>,
and this work has been identified with the statue under discussion.<a id="FNanchor_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">664</a>
Such an assumption is tenable only if the statue fits Pliny’s epithet.
This epithet appears to mean “undergoing a test,” and should refer
not to the statue, for we know nothing of any principle of selecting
statues, but to the athlete represented, the ἔγκρισις referring to the
selection of athletes before the contest.<a id="FNanchor_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">665</a> Pliny’s statue, then, presumably,
represented a pentathlete, not in action as the Vatican statue
does, but standing at rest before his judges. An all-round athlete
like a pentathlete would especially fit such an ordeal, and his statue,
albeit lighter and more graceful, would be an ideal one like the <i>Doryphoros</i>
of Polykleitos.<a id="FNanchor_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">666</a> We know how Alkamenes treated Hermes from
the bearded herma of that god found in Pergamon in 1903 and inscribed
with his name.<a id="FNanchor_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">667</a> Its massive features, broad forehead, and wide-opened
eyes bear no analogy to the head on the Vatican statue, nor to the one
with which Helbig would replace it. The ascription of the statue to
Naukydes is better founded. As the head of the statue is Attic and
not Argive, it is difficult to connect the work with a Peloponnesian
artist. However, the present head of the statue can not be shown to
belong to it, and no other replica has a head which can be proved to
belong to the body. A fragmentary replica of the statue, of good workmanship,
was found in Rome in 1910, and nearby a head, which must
belong to the torso.<a id="FNanchor_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">668</a> This head fits the Vatican statue better than the
head now on it, and certainly comes from the Polykleitan circle—both
head and body showing elements of Polykleitan style. This new
head represents the transition from Polykleitan art to that of the next
century, <i>i. e.</i>, to the head-types of Skopas, Praxiteles, and other Attic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
masters. Presumably, then, in the original of this fragment and its
replicas, we have a famous statue—the one by Naukydes mentioned
by Pliny.<a id="FNanchor_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">669</a></p>

<p>A more important question for our discussion is whether the Vatican
statue represents a victor (diskobolos) or Hermes. G. Habich has
argued that the pose of the statue, standing with the right foot advanced,
is not that of a diskobolos taking position. He quotes Kietz<a id="FNanchor_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">670</a>
to the effect that no vase-painting or other monument has the exact
position of this statue, and that the natural position for such a motive
is to advance the left foot.<a id="FNanchor_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">671</a> Moreover, the fingers of the right hand,
which are supposed especially to uphold the diskobolos theory, are
modern in all the replicas. On a coin of Amastris in Paphlagonia,
dating from the Antonines, and on one of Commodus struck at Philippopolis
in Thrace, a figure of Hermes is pictured, which, in all essentials,
reproduces the Vatican statue.<a id="FNanchor_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">672</a> Since the figure on the coins has a
kerykeion or training-rod in the right hand and a diskos as a minor
attribute in the left—merely a symbol of the god’s patronage of athletics—we
should see in the Vatican statue a representation of Hermes
as overseer of the palæstra. Pliny’s words—if we omit or transpose
the first <i>et</i>—refer, therefore, to a statue of <i>Hermes-Diskobolos</i> and
to the <i>Ram-offerer</i> which stood on the Athenian Akropolis, to two,
therefore, and not to three different monuments. We should restore all
the replicas of the statue, then, with the caduceus, to represent Hermes
as gymnasiarch. Though this interpretation of the statue has found
opponents,<a id="FNanchor_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">673</a> the evidence is strong that in it and its replicas we have an
athlete in the guise of Hermes. If we think that the caduceus can not
be brought into harmony with the chief motive of the statue, we must
conclude with Helbig that the copyist in one isolated case—the one
copied on the coins—changed an original victor statue into Hermes
by adding the herald staff. This would make it an instance, not of
assimilation of type, but of conversion.</p>

<p>A small bronze statuette standing upon a cylindrical base, which
was found in the sea off Antikythera (Cerigotto), reproduces almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
exactly the attitude of the statue of Naukydes (Fig. <a href="#f6">6</a>).<a id="FNanchor_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">674</a> Here the
left hand is stretched out horizontally at the elbow, but the right arm is
lost, so that we get no additional evidence as to the attribute carried.
Because of its correspondence with the aforementioned coins<a id="FNanchor_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">675</a> even in
detail, Bosanquet, followed by Svoronos, looks upon this “little masterpiece”
as a copy of the Argive master.</p>

<p>The statue discovered in the ruins of Hadrian’s villa in 1742 and now
in the Capitoline Museum,<a id="FNanchor_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">676</a> which represents an ephebe nude, except
for a chlamys thrown around the middle of his body, standing in an

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>—Bronze Statue of a Youth,

upon as a resting pancratiast.
Because of its general likeness to
Praxitelean figures—the head is
especially like the Olympia <i>Hermes</i>—Furtwaengler
interpreted
the figure as that of Hermes Logios
or Agoraios, the god of eloquence,
and assigned it to an
artist near to Praxiteles. However,
it is probably nothing else
than an idealized portrait of the
age of Hadrian or the Antonines,
and represents an ephebe, probably
a victor, assimilated to the
type of Hermes.<a id="FNanchor_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">677</a></p>

<p>Another example of assimilation
may be the much-discussed
bronze statue in the National
Museum at Athens, which was
accidentally discovered in 1901,
along with the rest of a cargo
of sculptures which had been
wrecked off the island of Antikythera
as it was on its way to
Rome about the beginning of
the first century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> (Fig. <a href="#f7">7</a>).<a id="FNanchor_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">678</a>
This statue, the best preserved
of the cargo, is a little over life<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>size
and represents a nude youth standing with languid grace, the
weight of his body resting upon the left leg, while the right is slightly
bent and the right arm is extended horizontally, the hand holding a
round object now lost and variously interpreted. In short, the pose
strongly resembles that of the Vatican <i>Apoxyomenos</i> (Pl. <a href="#p29">29</a>). Opinions
as to the age and authorship of this statue have been very diverse,
ranging from the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> down to Hellenistic times and
ascribing it to many masters and schools. Kabbadias, who published
it, in conjunction with the other objects, directly after their discovery,<a id="FNanchor_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">679</a>
thought it would prove to “rank as high among statues of bronze as does
the <i>Hermes</i> of Praxiteles among those of marble,” and characterized
it as “the most beautiful bronze statue that we possess.” Waldstein
praised it in no less exaggerated terms, and classed it along with the
<i>Charioteer</i> from Delphi (Fig. <a href="#f66">66</a>) as among the first Greek bronzes,
if not among the finest specimens of Greek sculpture.<a id="FNanchor_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">680</a> He followed
Kabbadias in assigning it to the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> and in interpreting
it as Hermes. He at first ascribed it to Praxiteles or his school, but
later he thought it more Skopaic.<a id="FNanchor_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">681</a> Th. Reinach placed it in the early
fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, but regarded it as the work of a sculptor influenced
by Polykleitos, naming the youthful Praxiteles or Euphranor.<a id="FNanchor_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">682</a> He
explained the pose as that of a man amusing a dog or a child with some
round object. A Greek scholar, A. S. Arvanitopoulos, assigned the
work to the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> and to the Attic school, referring it
possibly to Alkamenes.<a id="FNanchor_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">683</a> However, as soon as the statue was properly
cleansed and pieced together, its early dating was seen to be untenable,
and its Hellenistic character became evident.<a id="FNanchor_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">684</a> E. A. Gardner found
little resemblance in the head to that of the Praxitelean <i>Hermes</i>,
but more in the treatment of hair and eyes to that of the <i>Lansdowne<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
Herakles</i> (Pl. <a href="#p30">30</a>, Fig. <a href="#f71">71</a>,), which he ascribes to Skopas.<a id="FNanchor_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">685</a> He saw in its
labored and even anatomical modeling similarity to the <i>Apoxyomenos</i> of
the Vatican and concluded that it was, therefore, later than the fourth
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, being an eclectic piece disclosing influences of several
fourth-century sculptors, the work of an imitator especially of Praxiteles
and Skopas. K. T. Frost also assigned the work to the Hellenistic
age, but believed it was the statue of a god and not of a mortal, and
so followed Kabbadias and Waldstein in interpreting it as a Hermes
Logios.<a id="FNanchor_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">686</a> Gardner had interpreted it as probably the statue of an
athlete “in a somewhat theatrical pose,” though admitting it might
be a <i>genre</i> figure representing an athlete catching a ball, even if its
pose were against such an interpretation. In any case he was right
in saying that the pose, even if incapable of solution, was chosen by the
sculptor with a desire for display, as the centre of attraction is outside and not
inside the statue, and so is against the αὐτάρκεια of earlier works.
More recently, Bulle has asserted that it is not an original work at all,
but, as evinced by the hard treatment of the hair, merely a copy. He
also interprets it as a <i>Hermes</i>, restoring a kerykeion in the left hand,
and he likens its oratorical pose to that of the <i>Etruscan Orator</i> found
near Lago di Trasimeno in 1566 and now in the Museo Archeologico in
Florence, or the <i>Augustus</i> from Primaporta in the Vatican.<a id="FNanchor_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">687</a> For its date
he believes the statue marks the end of the Polykleitan “<i>Standmotif</i>”
(the breadth of the body showing Polykleitan influence, the head,
however, being too small and slender for the Argive master), and
the inception of the Lysippan (the free leg not drawn back, but
placed further out), as we see it in the <i>Apoxyomenos</i>. He concludes
that its author can not have been a great master.<a id="FNanchor_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">688</a> Doubtless, the
statue, which is the pride of the Athenian museum, is merely a
representative example of the kind of bronze statues made in great
numbers in the early Hellenistic age; but it shows the high degree of
excellence attained at that time by very mediocre artists.<a id="FNanchor_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">689</a></p>

<p>Apart from its period, our chief interest in the statue is to determine
whether a god or a mortal is portrayed. As there are no certain
remnants of the round object held in the right hand, and no other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
accessories, many interpretations have been possible. Especially the
gesture of the right arm has been the centre for such interpretations.
Some have looked upon this gesture as “transitory,” <i>i. e.</i>, the sweeping
gesture of an orator or god of orators, and this has led to the interpretation
of the statue as Hermes Logios.<a id="FNanchor_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">690</a> However, the round object
in the fingers is against this assumption. Others have therefore
regarded the gesture as “stationary,” <i>i. e.</i>, the figure is holding an
object in the hand, which is the main interest of the statue, and this
view has therefore also given rise to many different explanations.
Among mythological interpretations two have received careful attention.
Svoronos has reasoned most ingeniously that the statue represents
Perseus holding the head of Medusa in his hand, and finds a
similar type on coins, gems, and rings. Thus, almost the identical
pose of the statue is seen on an engraved stone in Florence, which
shows Perseus holding the Gorgon’s head, and Svoronos has restored
the bronze similarly.<a id="FNanchor_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">691</a> But certainly the right arm of the statue was
not intended to carry so great a weight. Others have seen in it the
statue of Paris by Euphranor, mentioned by Pliny as offering the apple
as prize of beauty to Aphrodite.<a id="FNanchor_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">692</a> But the statue scarcely reflects the
description of the <i>Paris</i> by Pliny. Other scholars have interpreted the
statue as that of a mortal. S. Reinach believes that it may be a youth
sacrificing.<a id="FNanchor_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">693</a> Kabbadias and E. A. Gardner admitted it might be the
statue of a ball-player as well as of Hermes. Since this latter interpretation
has become popular, let us consider its possibility at some length
in reference to ball-playing in antiquity. Now we know that ball-playing
(σφαιρίζειν, ἡ σφαιρικὴ τέχνη) was a favorite amusement of
the Greeks from the time of Nausikaa and her brothers in the Odyssey<a id="FNanchor_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">694</a>
to the end of Greek history, and that it was practiced at Rome
from the end of the Republic to the end of the Empire.<a id="FNanchor_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">695</a> It seems to
have been regarded less as a game than as a gymnastic exercise.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
Its origin is ascribed to the Spartans and to others.<a id="FNanchor_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">696</a> A special sort of
ball-playing was known as φαινίνδα,<a id="FNanchor_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">697</a> and this is described in a treatise
by the physician Galen, of the second century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span>, in which he recommended
ball-playing as one of the best exercises.<a id="FNanchor_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">698</a> Because of his
ability in the art of ball-playing, Aristonikos of Karystos, the ball-player
of Alexander the Great, received Athenian citizenship and was
honored with a statue.<a id="FNanchor_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">699</a> The philosopher Ktesibios of Chalkis was
fond of the game.<a id="FNanchor_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">700</a> A special room, called the σφαιριστήριον, was a
part of the later gymnasium.<a id="FNanchor_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">701</a> The game was specially indulged in
at Sparta. Several inscriptions, mostly from the age of the Antonines,
commemorate victories by teams of ball-players there.<a id="FNanchor_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">702</a> The name
σφαιρεῖς was given to Spartan youths in the first year of manhood.
These competitions took place in the Δρόμος at Sparta.<a id="FNanchor_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">703</a> Though,
then, we should naturally expect statues of ball-players, like the one in
Athens of Aristonikos already mentioned, the calm mien of the Cerigotto
bronze and the direction of the gaze are certainly, as Th. Reinach said
earlier, against interpreting it as the statue of one engaged in so active
a sport. Von Mach, because of its voluptuous appearance, thought it
might represent merely a <i>bon vivant</i>. While Lechat interpreted it as
possibly an athlete receiving a crown from Nike,<a id="FNanchor_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">704</a> Arvanitopoulos would
have the right hand either hold a lekythion or be quite empty, and the
left a strigil, thus restoring the statue as an apoxyomenos. S. Reinach
would regard it merely as a funerary monument.</p>

<p>In all this discrepancy of opinion it is not difficult to recognize
elements of both god and mortal blended. The resemblance in the
expression and features of the face to those of the Praxitelean <i>Hermes</i>,
even though superficial, as well as the pose of the right arm recall the
god; the muscular build of the figure fits either the god Hermes, in
his character of overseer of the sports of the palæstra, or an athlete.
It therefore seems reasonable to see in this Hellenistic statue of varied
artistic tendencies merely the representation of an athlete, perhaps of a
pentathlete, who is holding a crown or possibly an apple as a prize of
victory in the right hand, whose form and features have been assimilated
to those of Hermes.</p>

<p>How the statue of an indisputable Hermes Logios, on the other hand,
appears, may be seen in the <i>Hermes Ludovisi</i> of the Museo delle Terme,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Rome,<a id="FNanchor_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">705</a> and in its replica in the Louvre. The original of this marble
copy, dating from the middle of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, has been
variously ascribed to Pheidias,<a id="FNanchor_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">706</a> Myron,<a id="FNanchor_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">707</a> and others. In this statue
the petasos, chlamys, and kerykeion indicate the god, while the
position of the right arm raised toward the head<a id="FNanchor_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">708</a> and the earnest
expression of concentration in the face bespeak the god of oratory.
The careful replica of the statue, except the head, in the
Louvre, is the work of Kleomenes of Athens, a sculptor of the first
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> The copyist, however, has given to the original a
Roman portrait-head, whence it has been falsely called <i>Germanicus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">709</a>
The Paris statue, then, is merely another example of the conversion
of an original god-type, for the sculptor wished to represent a Roman
under the guise of Hermes Logios, since the inscribed tortoise shell
retained at the feet is a well-known attribute of the god.</p>

<p>Another excellent example of a true Hermes head is the fine Polykleitan
one in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, which is a copy of a
well-known type represented by the <i>Boboli Hermes</i> in Florence and
other replicas.<a id="FNanchor_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">710</a> Though S. Reinach classed this head as Kresilæan,<a id="FNanchor_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">711</a>
its true Polykleitan character has been established,<a id="FNanchor_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">712</a> even if it does
not merit the praise formerly given it by Robinson, of being “easily
the best extant copy of a work by Polykleitos.”<a id="FNanchor_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">713</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>The so-called <i>Jason</i> of the Louvre and its many replicas<a id="FNanchor_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">714</a> (Fig. <a href="#f8">8</a>)
probably represent athletes in the guise of Hermes. These statues
are copies of an original of the end of the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, when
<span class="figright300"><a id="f8"></a>
<img src="images/i_p086.jpg" width="300" height="560" alt="Statue of the so-called Jason" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span>—Statue of the so-called <i>Jason</i>
(<i>Sandal-binder</i>). Louvre, Paris.</span></span>
the favorite motive originated—probably
with Lysippos—of
representing a figure, as in this
case, with one foot on a rock,
bending over and tying a sandal.
Since the replicas in Munich
and Paris extend both arms
to the right foot, while those in
London and Athens extend the
left arm over the breast, with
the hand resting on the right
knee, Klein has argued two different
versions of a common
type. He compares the former
with figures on the west frieze
of the Parthenon, the latter
with the well-known relief of
Nike tying her sandal, from
the Nike balustrade now in the
Akropolis Museum. The one
type he assigns to Lysippos,
the other (with both arms down)
to an earlier artist. However,
the proportions of both groups
agree with the Lysippan canon
and so we should assume only
one artist. The discussion
whether the figure is tying
or untying the sandal is as
barren as the similar one raised
about the Athena from the
Nike balustrade;<a id="FNanchor_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">715</a> but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
question as to who is represented by the type is worthy of careful
consideration. The statue in the Louvre at first was believed to
represent Cincinnatus called from the plough, but Winckelmann,
without evidence, gave it its present name of <i>Jason</i>. In recent
years it has been interpreted as Hermes tying on his sandals, his
head raised to hearken to the behest of Zeus before going forth
from Olympos on his duties as messenger. This interpretation was
based on the description of a statue of the god by Christodoros,<a id="FNanchor_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">716</a> and
the fact that the type conforms with a representation of Hermes on a
coin of Markianopolis in Mœsia.<a id="FNanchor_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">717</a> Arndt has argued from the coin
and from the motive of the statue that Hermes and not an athlete
is intended; thus the inclination of the head, he thinks, is not that of
an athlete looking out over the theatre, since the regard is not far off,
but merely upward; the presence of the chlamys and the sandals
also fits the god. He therefore refers the copies to a Hermes-type
originated by Lysippos. But Froehner’s idea that they represent
athletes, even if the type were invented for Hermes, is in line with
our idea of the assimilation of athlete types to that of Hermes. In
this connection it may be added that the head of an athlete in Turin,<a id="FNanchor_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">718</a>
dating from the late third or early second century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, is very similar
to that of the Louvre figure, and especially to the Fagan head in London.
The pose of an athlete binding on a sandal was doubtless chosen
by the sculptor merely to show the play of the muscles.</p>

<p>Heads of Hermes are often found with victor fillets,<a id="FNanchor_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">719</a> and some of
these doubtless are from statues of victors. The beautiful fourth-century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> Parian marble head of a beardless youth in the British
Museum, known as the Aberdeen head,<a id="FNanchor_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">720</a> which resembles so
strongly the Praxitelean <i>Hermes</i>, although lacking its delicacy, may
be from a victor statue assimilated to the god, for holes show that
it once wore a metal wreath. In Roman days the <i>Doryphoros</i>
of Polykleitos, as we have seen, was adapted to represent Hermes,
and was set up in various palæstræ and gymnasia. The Naples
copy of the <i>Doryphoros</i> stood in the Palaistra of Pompeii,<a id="FNanchor_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">721</a> and statues
of ephebes carrying lances (hastae, δόρατα) and called <i>Achilleae</i> by
Pliny,<a id="FNanchor_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">722</a> which must have been largely copies of Polykleitos’ great
statue, were set up in gymnasia. A later type of Hermes-head often<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
appeared on bodies of the <i>Doryphoros</i>,<a id="FNanchor_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">723</a> while other statues, showing
the body of the <i>Doryphoros</i> draped with the chlamys,<a id="FNanchor_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">724</a> and many
torsos following the attitude and form of this statue, have the chlamys,
which shows that they were intended for the god.<a id="FNanchor_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">725</a> Hermes in the <i>Doryphoros</i>
pose, in a bronze of the British Museum,<a id="FNanchor_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">726</a> is probably intended
for an athlete. Furtwaengler has shown<a id="FNanchor_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">727</a> that the old Argive schema
of the boxer Aristion at Olympia by Polykleitos<a id="FNanchor_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">728</a> was used in the
master’s circle for statues of Hermes. The best preserved example
of a number of existing statues of this type is one in Lansdowne
House, London,<a id="FNanchor_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">729</a> in the pose of the Aristion, holding an object—probably
a kerykeion—in the hand and a chlamys over the left shoulder.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Athlete Statues Assimilated to Types of Apollo.</span></h4>

<p>Apollo figures in mythology as an athlete. In the Iliad, at the
opening of the boxing match between Epeios and Euryalos,<a id="FNanchor_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">730</a> he is
mentioned as the god of boxing, which refers, perhaps, to his presiding
over the education of youths (κουροτρόφος) and to his gift of manly
prowess. Pausanias records that he overcame Hermes in running and
Ares in boxing.<a id="FNanchor_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">731</a> He gives these victories of the god as the reason why
the flute played a Pythian air at the later pentathlon. Plutarch says
that the Delphians sacrificed to Apollo the boxer (πύκτης), and the Cretans
and Spartans to Apollo the runner (δρομαῖος).<a id="FNanchor_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">732</a> Apollo’s fight with
Herakles to wrest from the hero the stolen tripod of Delphi,<a id="FNanchor_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">733</a> which is
the subject of many surviving works of art,<a id="FNanchor_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">734</a> is outside the realm of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
athletics. As with Hermes, it is often difficult to distinguish between
statues of Apollo and those of victors assimilated to his type. A
good instance of this doubt is afforded by the long and indecisive
discussion of the monument represented by several replicas, especially
by the <i>Choiseul-Gouffier</i> statue in the British Museum (Pl. <a  href="#p7A">7A</a>), and
the so-called <i>Apollo-on-the-Omphalos</i> (Pl. <a  href="#p7B">7B</a>) found in 1862 in the
ruins of the theatre of Dionysos at Athens, and now in the National
Museum there.<a id="FNanchor_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">735</a> The bronze original of these marble copies must
have been famous, to judge from the number of replicas of it. It has
been ascribed to many different artists—to Kalamis, Pythagoras,
Alkamenes, Pasiteles,<a id="FNanchor_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">736</a> to one on more, to another on less probability. As
A. H. Smith has pointed out, the <i>krobylos</i> treatment of the hair almost
certainly indicates an Attic sculptor of the first half of the fifth century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> But here again the main interest in these copies is to determine
whether the original represented Apollo or an athlete. The
connection between the Athens replica and the <i>omphalos</i> found with
it is all but disproved<a id="FNanchor_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">737</a> and can not be used as evidence that the
statue represents the god. However, the original has been called an
Apollo because of the presence of a quiver on certain of the copies.
Thus, while we have a tree-trunk beside the <i>Choiseul-Gouffier</i> example,
we have a quiver on the copy in the Palazzo Torlonia in Rome,<a id="FNanchor_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">738</a> and on a
similar statue in the Fridericianum in Kassel,<a id="FNanchor_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">739</a> and both tree and quiver
on the fragment of a leg from the Palatine now in the Museo delle Terme.<a id="FNanchor_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">740</a>
The Ventnor head in the British Museum<a id="FNanchor_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">741</a> has long locks suited to
Apollo, and the head from Kyrene there<a id="FNanchor_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">742</a> was actually found in a
temple of Apollo. It has also been pointed out that the head of
a similar figure, undoubtedly an Apollo, appears on a relief in the
Capitoline Museum,<a id="FNanchor_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">743</a> and a similar figure is found on a red-figured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
krater in Bologna, which shows the god standing on a pillar with a
laurel wreath in the lowered left hand and a bowl in the right.<a id="FNanchor_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">744</a> On
coins of Athens, moreover, we see the figure of Apollo in a similar
attitude with a laurel wreath in the lowered right hand and a bow
in the left.<a id="FNanchor_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">745</a> From such evidence a good case for an Apollo has
been made out by many scholars—A. H. Smith, Winter,<a id="FNanchor_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">746</a> Helbig,<a id="FNanchor_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">747</a>
Conze,<a id="FNanchor_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">748</a> Furtwaengler,<a id="FNanchor_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">749</a> Schreiber,<a id="FNanchor_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">750</a> Dickins, and others. The evidence
of the quiver in the delle Terme fragment and the Torlonia replica
is looked upon as a deliberate device of the copyist to indicate the god.
The attempt especially to connect it with the <i>Apollo Alexikakos</i> of
Kalamis<a id="FNanchor_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">751</a> must certainly fall, since the date is about the only thing
in its favor. In the long list of statues ascribed to this sculptor,<a id="FNanchor_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">752</a>
there is none of an athlete, and the <i>Choiseul-Gouffier</i> type, whether
it represents Apollo or an athlete, has a markedly athletic character.
If the Delphi <i>Charioteer</i> (Fig. <a href="#f66">66</a>) be ascribed to Kalamis, certainly
this type of statue can have nothing to do with him or his school. Nor
is the type at all identical with the <i>Alexikakos</i> appearing on coins of
Athens,<a id="FNanchor_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">753</a> in which the locks of hair, in the true archaic fashion of a
cultus statue, fall down over the god’s shoulders. Besides, the work
of Kalamis, characterized by λεπτότης  and χάρις,<a id="FNanchor_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">754</a> must have been
of the delicate later archaic style of the transition period.</p>

<p>Waldstein, however, has made a good case against the evidence
adduced for interpreting the original as Apollo and he believes that
the statue represents an athlete.<a id="FNanchor_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">755</a> The thongs thrown over the stump
in the <i>Choiseul-Gouffier</i> statue, doubtless those of a boxer, seem to
point to an athlete for that copy at least. The muscular form and
athletic coiffure of all the copies also point to the same conclusion, even
if Waldstein’s ascription of the original statue to the boxer Euthymos,
whose statue by Pythagoras of Rhegion stood in the Altis at Olympia,<a id="FNanchor_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">756</a>
is only a guess. Wolters thinks the <i>Choiseul-Gouffier</i> statue may
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>represent an athlete, but is against Waldstein’s ascription of the work
to Pythagoras.<a id="FNanchor_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">757</a></p>

<p>Though differing in detail, the rendering of the hair, common to
all the replicas, is a purely athletic coiffure. The argument for
attributing the original to Apollo, based on the curls around the face,
is of no importance, since a similar coiffure appears on many ephebe
heads by various Attic masters of the same or a slightly earlier period.
The hair treatment on a little-known replica of the head in the British
Museum<a id="FNanchor_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">758</a> gives us an additional argument in determining whether
the original was an Apollo or not. On this head there are two corkscrew
curls side by side just back of the ears, which are so inorganically
attached and so unsuited to the style of head as to make us believe
that they were added by the copyist, even if their absence in other
copies were not proof enough of this fact. Apparently the copyist
adopted a well-known type of athlete and tried to convert it into an
Apollo by the use of this Apolline hair attribute. The only other
Apolline attribute, the quiver on the copies in the Palazzo Torlonia<a id="FNanchor_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">759</a>
and Museo delle Terme, may have been added as a fortuitous adjunct
by the copyists, who were converting an original athlete statue into
one of Apollo. It may be added, also, that the quiver does not always
indicate the god, as we shall see in discussing the Delian <i>Diadoumenos</i>
(Pl. <a href="#p18">18</a>). When we consider, therefore, the athletic pose, the massive
outline and proportions, the high-arched chest, the muscular arms
and thighs, the accentuation of the veins,<a id="FNanchor_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">760</a> the fashion of the hair,
and the relatively small size of the head, together with the presence
of the boxing-thongs on the London example, it seems reasonable to
conclude that in this series of copies we may see an original athlete
statue, which in certain cases was later transformed into statues of
Apollo. Even if the original was actually an Apollo, its proportions
were far better suited to the patron of athletic exercises than to the
leader of a celestial choir.</p>

<p>An instance of the similar use of the same type of head is shown
by the colossal statue of Apollo unearthed at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">761</a> Here we see
the same coiffure as in the heads discussed, but the presence of the
remnants of a lyre indubitably shows that this copy was intended for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
Apollo, and so it has been rightly assigned by Treu, not to the fifth, but
to a later century. When long hair was no longer the fashion for
athletes, a later artist might mistakenly think that the earlier plaits
were genuinely Apolline, though we know that they were common to
all early athletic art. Another head in the British Museum has been
ably discussed by Mrs. Strong,<a id="FNanchor_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">762</a> who shows that it comes from an
Apollo and not from an athlete statue. It is similar to an Apollo
pictured on a stater struck at Mytilene about 400 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>,<a id="FNanchor_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">763</a> and consequently,
like the statue from Olympia, it is merely an instance of
the process of converting an athlete statue into that of an Apollo.</p>

<p>The marble copy of the <i>Diadoumenos</i> of Polykleitos, found on
the island of Delos in 1894, and now in the National Museum in
Athens<a id="FNanchor_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">764</a> (Pl. <a href="#p18">18</a>), has a chlamys and a quiver introduced on the marble
support against the right leg. Until recently these attributes were
regarded as the arbitrary introductions of the Hellenistic copyist,
who wished to convert the famous athlete statue into one of Apollo,
but lately it has been suggested that they belonged to the original
statue, which is assumed to have represented Apollo. Thus, Hauser
has propounded the theory that the <i>Diadoumenos</i> was originally an
Apollo.<a id="FNanchor_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">765</a> He does not believe that the Delian sculptor could have
transformed a short-haired athlete into an Apollo, since the typical
Apollo after the time of Praxiteles was never represented as athletic.
He later supported his theory that the <i>Diadoumenos</i> was originally an
Apollo by the evidence of a bronze statuette and a Delphian coin, and
reasserted his view that so virile a short-haired Apollo did not originate
with the later copyist, but in the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">766</a> Hauser’s argument
that Apollo was the original of the <i>Diadoumenos</i> seems as unsuccessful
as his contention that Polykleitos’ other great creation, the
<i>Doryphoros</i>, is to be classed as an <i>Achilles</i>.<a id="FNanchor_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">767</a> Loewy has sufficiently
opposed Hauser’s theory of the <i>Diadoumenos</i>, by showing that the palm-tree
prop in all the marble replicas of that statue points to athletic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
victories.<a id="FNanchor_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">768</a> He rightly explains the Apolline attributes of the Delian
copy as the perfectly natural additions of an artist who lived on the
island reputed to be the birthplace of the god. His ascription of the
Polykleitan statue to the pentathlete Pythokles, the base of whose
statue at Olympia has been found,<a id="FNanchor_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">769</a> is doubtful. More recently Ada
Maviglia has shown the literary grounds for regarding the <i>Diadoumenos</i>
as an athlete, and not an Apollo.<a id="FNanchor_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">770</a></p>

<p>The difficulty of distinguishing between statues of athletes and Apollo
is also shown by the very beautiful fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> Parian marble
head in Turin,<a id="FNanchor_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">771</a> which is certainly a copy of an original Greek bronze.
Furtwaengler, because of the hair, wrongly believed it the head of a
diadoumenos, and connected it with Kresilas,<a id="FNanchor_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">772</a> while Amelung and
Wace<a id="FNanchor_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">773</a> have found in it Attic and Polykleitan influences. The hair is
parted over the centre of the forehead, as in the <i>Diadoumenos</i> and
the <i>Doryphoros</i>, and in other works attributed to the Polykleitan
school, while the locks over the ears and the plaits wound round
the head have Attic analogues.<a id="FNanchor_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">774</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Athlete Statues Assimilated to Types of Herakles.</span></h4>

<p>Herakles was the reputed founder of the games at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">775</a> He
was a famous wrestler, Pausanias frequently mentioning his combats
with giants.<a id="FNanchor_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">776</a> He won in both wrestling and the pankration at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">777</a>
In connection with the victory of Straton of Alexandria, who
won in these two events on the same day,<a id="FNanchor_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">778</a> Pausanias names three men
before him and three men after him who won in these events on the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
day.<a id="FNanchor_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">779</a> We learn their dates from Africanus.<a id="FNanchor_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">780</a> After the date of the last
of these victories, Ol. 204 (&#8239;=&#8239;37 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span>), the Elean umpires, in order to
check professionalism, refused to allow contestants to enter for both
events.<a id="FNanchor_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">781</a> To win the crown of wild olive in both these events was
therefore regarded as a great honor, and in the Olympic lists a special
note was made of such victors, who were called πρῶτος, δεύτερος,
τρίτος, κ. τ. λ., ἀφ’ Ἡρακλέους.<a id="FNanchor_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">782</a> They also received the title of
παράδοξος or παραδοξονίκης.<a id="FNanchor_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">783</a> Statues of Herakles, like those of Hermes
and Theseus, were commonly set up in gymnasia and palæstræ
throughout Greece,<a id="FNanchor_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">784</a> and it was but natural that Olympic victors,
especially those in the two events mentioned, should want their
statues assimilated to those of the hero. The difficulty of deciding
whether a given statue is one of Herakles or of a victor is even greater
than that of distinguishing between statues of victors and those of
Hermes or Apollo. To quote Homolle: “<i>Maintes fois, comme pour la
tête d’Olympie, comme pour plusieurs autres encore, on peut se demander
si le personnage représenté est le héros luimême sous les traits d’un
athlête ou un athlête fait à l’image du héros</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">785</a> In reference to the
statue of Agias by Lysippos discovered at Delphi, which is an excellent
example of the assimilation process which we are discussing, he
continues: “<i>Ici en particulier, étant donnée la nature du monument, il est
permis de supposer que l’auteur ... ait voulu élever le personnage à la
hauteur idéale du type divin en qu’ Agias ait été assimilé à Héraclès</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">786</a></p>

<p>We shall discuss a few examples of this process of assimilation to
types of Herakles. Our ascription of the head from Olympia mentioned
by Homolle, which was found in the ruins of the Gymnasion, to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
statue of the Akarnanian pancratiast Philandridas by Lysippos<a id="FNanchor_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">787</a> (<a href="#fr">Frontispiece</a>
and Fig. <a href="#f69">69</a>) will be discussed in a later chapter.<a id="FNanchor_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">788</a> The swollen
ears and hair-fillet might pass for hero or mortal, for in deciding
whether a given head represents Herakles or a victor, the ears are not
the deciding criterion, since many heroes had the “pancratiast” swollen
ear, as we shall see later. A good example of assimilation is seen in the
beautiful little marble head of a man, found in Athens and now in the
Glyptothek Ny-Carlsberg in Copenhagen, dating from the early Hellenistic
age.<a id="FNanchor_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">789</a> As traces of color remain in the hair, some have thought
that this head came from the reliefs on the “Alexander” sarcophagus
from Sidon, belonging to the body of a headless youth represented there.
Though the marble (Pentelic) and the dimensions would fit, it would be
the only head on the sarcophagus with a band in the hair, and so the
question can not be definitely decided.<a id="FNanchor_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">790</a> The head was at first called a
Herakles, though Furtwaengler rightly saw in it an ideal representation
of an athlete, even if the ears are not swollen. A bronze head of a youth
from Herculaneum, now in Naples, is evidently a part of the statue
of a victor or of Herakles.<a id="FNanchor_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">791</a> A Polykleitan ephebe head-type, with
rolled fillet around the hair and swollen ears, represented by replicas in
Naples, in Rome, and elsewhere, may represent a boxer in the guise of the
hero.<a id="FNanchor_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">792</a> In the Roman copy of the group of Herakles and Telephos in the
Museo Chiaramonti of the Vatican, Herakles, still the god, wears a fillet.<a id="FNanchor_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">793</a>
Similarly, a colossal head of mediocre workmanship in the Sala dei Busti
of the Vatican represents the hero with a fillet,<a id="FNanchor_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">794</a> while another head
in the Capitoline Museum, with fillet and swollen ears, seems to represent
Herakles as a victorious athlete.<a id="FNanchor_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">795</a> Many other heads in various
museums, which are commonly called heads of Herakles, may represent
athletes in the heroic guise. A good example is the Parian marble
terminal bust of the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, representing a young Herakles
wreathed with poplar, now in the British Museum (Fig. <a href="#f31">31</a>).<a id="FNanchor_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">796</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
In this head the ears are bruised. It seems to have been copied from
some well-known statue of Lysippan or Skopaic tendencies. Another
head in the British Museum shows the beardless hero, his hair encircled
by a diadem, and his ears broken and crushed.<a id="FNanchor_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">797</a> This almost
certainly comes from a victor statue. Many bronze statuettes in the
British Museum may be interpreted either as Herakles or as victors.<a id="FNanchor_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">798</a>
A bronze from Corfu represents a nude Herakles or an athlete, with
the left foot advanced and the left hand extended. The objects held in
both hands are lost, but the challenging pose and expression indicate
a boxer.<a id="FNanchor_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">799</a> Similarly a small bronze in Berlin, represented with a
fillet and in the walking pose, may be a Herakles or a victor.<a id="FNanchor_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">800</a> Duetschke
gives two examples of heads in the Uffizi, both of them having fillets,
and one of them having swollen ears, which may come from statues
of the hero or victors.<a id="FNanchor_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">801</a> Heads of the hero with the rolled fillet can not,
however, according to Furtwaengler, be classed as victors, since he
believes that this attribute was borrowed from the symposium, to
distinguish the glorified hero rejoicing in the celestial banquet.<a id="FNanchor_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">802</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Athletes Represented as the Dioskouroi.</span></h4>

<p>Kastor is said to have won the foot-race and Polydeukes the boxing
match, at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">803</a> They had an altar at the entrance to the Hippodrome
there,<a id="FNanchor_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">804</a> and were called “Starters of the Race” at Sparta.<a id="FNanchor_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">805</a>
A stadion, in which they were fabled to have contended, was shown in
Hermione, in Corinthia.<a id="FNanchor_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">806</a> Kastor was a famous horse-racer in Homer
and later writers,<a id="FNanchor_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">807</a> and Polydeukes a famous boxer,<a id="FNanchor_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">808</a> both being κατ’
ἐξοχήν the rider and boxer respectively.<a id="FNanchor_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">809</a> Scenes showing Athena setting
garlands on victorious hoplite racers (?) appear on reliefs of the Dioskouroi
from Tarentum.<a id="FNanchor_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">810</a> An archaic Argive inscription tells how a
certain Aischylos won the stade-race four times and the hoplite-race<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
three times at Argos, for which he dedicated a slab to the Dioskouroi,
which depicted them in relief.<a id="FNanchor_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">811</a> An inscribed bronze quoit of the
sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> from Kephallenia(?), now in the British Museum,
was dedicated to the two heroes by Exoïdas for a victory (apparently
in the pentathlon).<a id="FNanchor_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">812</a> A bronze four-spoked wheel with a dedicatory
inscription in their honor was found at Argos, probably the remnant of a
monument erected for a chariot victory.<a id="FNanchor_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">813</a> Doubtless certain victor
statues were assimilated to them, though we have no direct evidence
of the fact. Ordinary dead men appeared in the guise of the Dioskouroi
on sepulchral reliefs, just as we have seen that in statuary they
were heroized into statues of Hermes. Thus a grave-relief in honor
of Pamphilos and Alexandros in Verona shows on the projecting lower
rim the two Dioskouroi, the figure to the right carrying a lance in the
right hand and holding the bridle of a horse in the left, while the figure
to the left holds a lance in the left hand and touches a horse’s head with
the right.<a id="FNanchor_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">814</a> A votive relief in the British Museum represents two youths
on horseback, who, despite the absence of the conical cap or pilleus,
are probably the Dioskouroi.<a id="FNanchor_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">815</a> Their short hair is bound with diadems,
which shows that the dead men may have been victors.</p>

<p>Sufficient examples of the process of assimilation have now been
given to prove that it was not an uncommon device of the ancient
sculptor and to show the difficulty of distinguishing between types
of gods and athletes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>VICTOR STATUES REPRESENTED AT REST.</small></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plates 8–21 and Figures 9–31.</span></p>

<p>We have seen<a id="FNanchor_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">816</a> that it was a very old custom in Greece to dedicate
statues of victors at the great national games to the god in whose
honor the games were held. On many sites, especially at Olympia,
tiny statuettes of clay or bronze of very primitive technique have been
found in great numbers, which represent victors in many attitudes
and ways—as horsemen, warriors, charioteers, etc. By the sixth
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> this ancient custom, as we learn from literary, epigraphical,
and monumental sources, had developed, with the rapid progress
attained by the sculptor’s art, into the regular practice of erecting
life-size statues of athletes at the site of the games or in the native city
of the victor. Especially at Olympia hundreds of such monuments
were gradually collected, whose numbers and beauty must have exerted
an overwhelming impression on the visitor to the Altis. We shall now
begin the consideration of these monuments in detail.</p>

<p>The victor statues at Olympia, as elsewhere, may be conveniently
divided into two main groups—those which represent the victor as
standing or seated at rest, before or after the contest, and those which
represent him in movement, <i>i. e.</i>, in some contest schema.<a id="FNanchor_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">817</a> Examples
of statues of athletes represented at rest are common in Greek athletic
sculpture. We need only mention the so-called <i>Oil-pourer</i> of Munich
(Pl. <a href="#p11">11</a>), who is represented as pouring oil over his body to make
his limbs more supple for the coming wrestling bout; the <i>Diadoumenos</i>
of Polykleitos (Pls. 17, 18, and Fig. <a href="#f28">28</a>), who is binding a victor fillet
around his head after a successful encounter; the <i>Apoxyomenos</i> of
the school of Lysippos (Pl. <a href="#p29">29</a>), representing an athlete scraping off
the oil and dirt from his body after his victory. In this class of
statues, which forms by far the greater number and shows the richer
motives, the poses are quiet and reserved, the figures are compact,
and the expression earnest and even thoughtful. As examples of
statues represented in movement we need only recall such well-known
works as the <i>Diskobolos</i> of Myron with its rhythmic lines and vivacious
expression (Pls. 22, 23, and Figs. 34, 35); the bronze wrestlers of
Naples, who are bending eagerly forward watching for a grip (Fig. <a href="#f51">51</a>);
or the artistically intertwined pancratiast group of Florence (Pl. <a href="#p25">25</a>).<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
Such monuments show us the varied poses, the choice of the critical
moment, the truth to life, and the masterly rhythm attained by certain
sculptors.</p>

<h3>THE APOLLO TYPE.</h3>

<p>In this chapter we shall confine ourselves almost entirely to the
statues of victors represented at rest, discussing those represented in
motion chiefly in the next. Most of the oldest statues at Olympia,
dating from a time when there were few variations in the sculptural
type, must have been represented at rest and in the schema of the so-called
“Apollos.” Ever since the discovery of the <i>Apollo of Thera</i> in
1836 (Fig. <a href="#f9">9</a>), this <i>genre</i> of sculpture, the most characteristic of the early
period, extending from the end of the seventh century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> to the
time of the gable groups of Aegina, has been carefully studied. Though
we now know that the type passed equally well for gods and mortals,<a id="FNanchor_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">818</a>
we still keep the name, because of its familiarity and for the sake of
having a common designation. That this type actually represented
Olympic victors we have indubitable proof. Pausanias mentions the
stone victor statue of the pancratiast Arrhachion, dating from the first
half of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, which stood in the agora of his native
town Phigalia. He describes it as archaic in pose, with the feet close
together and the arms hanging down the sides to the hips—the typical
“Apollo” schema.<a id="FNanchor_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">819</a> Moreover, this very statue has survived to our
time (Fig. <a href="#f79">79</a>).<a id="FNanchor_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">820</a> A study, therefore, of this type of statue will give us
an idea of how some of the early statues at Olympia looked.</p>

<p>The “Apollo” statues,<a id="FNanchor_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">821</a>
because of differences in facial expression,
have been conveniently divided into two groups: those represented by
the examples from Thera, Melos, Volomandra, Tenea, etc., sometimes
named the “grinning” group, because the corners of the mouth are
turned upwards into the so-called “archaic smile,” and those represented
by the examples from Orchomenos, the precinct of Mount
Ptoion, and elsewhere, named the “stolid” group, because in them the
mouth forms a straight line.<a id="FNanchor_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">822</a>
There are, however, essential differences

<span class="figright250"><a id="f9"></a>
<img src="images/i_p101.jpg" width="250" height="476" alt="Statue of so-called
Apollo of Thera" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span>—Statue of so-called
<i>Apollo of Thera</i>. National Museum, Athens.</span></span>

between the statues of each group. Thus, while some of both groups—<i>e. g.</i>,
the examples from Melos, Volomandra, and Orchomenos—have
square shoulders, most of the others have sloping ones. The type
gradually improved, as in each successive attempt the sculptor overcame
difficulties, until finally revolutionary changes had taken place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
in the original form. This improvement is seen in the treatment of the
hair, in the modeling of the face and body, and in the proportions of the
statues. In a head of a statue from Mount Ptoion<a id="FNanchor_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">823</a>—which is broken
off at the neck—we seem to see the sculptor in wood making his first
attempt in stone. In the archaic example from Thera<a id="FNanchor_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">824</a> (Fig. <a href="#f9">9</a>) the arms
hang straight down close to the sides, as in the statue of Arrhachion,
being detached only slightly from the body at the elbows, showing that


the artist was afraid that they might
break off. In other examples, as in the
one from Orchomenos<a id="FNanchor_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">825</a> (Fig. <a href="#f10">10</a>) and one
from Mount Ptoion<a id="FNanchor_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">826</a> (Fig. <a href="#f11">11</a>), the space
between the arms and the body has become
larger, while in the example from
Melos<a id="FNanchor_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">827</a> (Fig. <a href="#f12">12</a>) only the hands are glued
to the thighs. In the “Apollo” found
at Tenea in 1846, and now in Munich<a id="FNanchor_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">828</a>
(Pl. <a href="#p8A">8A</a>), the arms are free, but the hands
are held fast to the body by the retention
of small marble bridges between
them and the thighs. The final step<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
has been taken in two examples from Mount Ptoion (Fig. <a href="#f13">13</a>), in
which the arms from the shoulders down are free from the bodies.<a id="FNanchor_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">829</a>
The bridges shown on the photograph in the figure to the left, which
connect the forearms with the thighs, are of plaster, being added at
the time the statue was set up in Athens.<a id="FNanchor_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">830</a> The figure to the right
is smaller and clearly discloses Aeginetan influence. The audacity
of the sculptor in entirely freeing the arms in both examples was
rewarded by the arms being broken off. Similarly, in the <i>Strangford
Apollo</i> of the British Museum (Fig. <a href="#f14">14</a>),<a id="FNanchor_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">831</a> the arms, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
hung loose from the shoulders, are broken away. The larger statue
from Mount Ptoion just mentioned also has the arms slightly crooked
at the elbows, the forearms being extended at an oblique angle to the
body. This represents an intermediate stage between the earlier
“Apollos,” in which the arms adhered vertically to the sides of the
body (as <i>e. g.</i>, in the ones from Orchomenos,
Thera, Melos, and Tenea), and the later
ones, in which the arms were bent, the forearms
being extended at right angles to the
body (see Figs. 15 and 19).<a id="FNanchor_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">832</a></p>

The example from Thera shows the archaic
method of working in planes parallel
to front and side and at right angles to one
another, the corners of the square block being
merely rounded off. The outlines of
muscles are indicated by shallow grooves,
which do not affect the flatness of the surface,
and there is but little facial expression.
We see the chest outlined in some examples
from Aktion.<a id="FNanchor_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">833</a>
In the Melian example the
rectangular form is modified by cutting
away the sides obliquely in arms and body;
here there is more expression in the face,
and the treatment of the hair and the proportions
of the body are more developed.
In the example from Orchomenos we see a
great improvement in form. Here, as in
later Bœotian examples, the original rectangular
form of the example from Thera
has become round, so that a horizontal
cross-section through the waist is almost
circular; the muscles of the abdomen are
indicated and the skin is naturalistically
shown in the back and at the elbows. In
later Bœotian examples from Mount Ptoion,
which are directly developed from the Orchomenos
type,<a id="FNanchor_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">834</a> the form is lighter and the
proportions more graceful. In one example (Fig. <a href="#f13">13</a>, left) even the
veins are shown. In the example mentioned above as showing
Aeginetan influence, and dated about 500 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>,<a id="FNanchor_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">835</a> the muscles are
clearly marked, just as in the <i>Strangford</i> example and in the statues
from the temple at Aegina, showing that foreign art had been intro<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>duced
into Bœotia by that time. In the example from Volomandra
in Attica,<a id="FNanchor_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">836</a> we see affinity to the examples from Thera and Melos, but
Attic softness in the carving of the shoulders and in the proportions.
In the <i>Apollo of Tenea</i> (Pl. <a href="#p8A">8A</a>), “by far the most beautiful preserved
statue of archaic sculpture,”<a id="FNanchor_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">837</a> a statue most carefully worked, we see a
Peloponnesian example of the beginning of the sixth or even of the end
of the seventh century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> Here the sculptor has shown great care
in executing details and in the proportions. The eyes are not flat, but
convex, and are wide open as in most of the earlier examples. The
downward flow of the lines of the statue is striking, which is caused
by the sloping shoulders and the elongated triangular-shaped abdomen.
The slimness of the figure, with the contour of bones and muscles, is
remarkable at so early a date. The fashioning of the knees is detailed.
When we contrast this tall, slim, agile statue with the massively
square-built Argive type found at Delphi (Pl. <a href="#p8B">8B</a>), we find it reason<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>able
to suspect that the <i>Apollo of Tenea</i> is an imported work, coming
probably from the islands.<a id="FNanchor_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">838</a> The two statues of (?) Kleobis and Biton,
discovered at Delphi in 1893 and 1894, and inscribed with the name
of the sculptor Polymedes of Argos, have added much to our knowledge
of early Argive sculpture (Pl. <a href="#p8B">8B</a>,
= Statue A).<a id="FNanchor_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">839</a> This Polymedes may have
been one of the predecessors acknowledged
by Eutelidas and Chrysothemis, among the
first victor statuaries known to us by name,
in the epigram preserved by Pausanias from
the base of the monument of Damaretos and
his son Theopompos at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">840</a> The epigram,
in any case, implies that the reputation
of the Argive school in athletic sculpture
was already well established by the end
of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> These massively
built statues, dating from the beginning of
the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, outline the muscles
to a certain extent, even showing the line of
the false ribs by incised lines. They display,
however, but little detail in modeling,
except in the knees, where the artist has tried
to indicate the bones and muscles. The
features of the large heads are without
expression; the large eyes are flat and not
convex, as in the example from Tenea,
though the Argive artist was, perhaps, later
than the Corinthian one, and a long distance
removed from the later artist of the Ligourió bronze (Fig. <a href="#f16">16</a>), to be
discussed later.</p>

In all these “Apollos,” which have been found all over the Greek
world from Naukratis in Egypt to Ambrakia, and along the Asian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
coast and on the Aegean Isles, the archaic artists have attempted, by
their modeling of the muscles, especially of the chest and abdomen, to
express trained strength. The heavy Argive examples, which may be
said to be the prototypes of the Ligourió bronze and of the <i>Doryphoros</i>
of Polykleitos (Pl. <a href="#p4">4</a> and Fig. <a href="#f48">48</a>), are in strong contrast with the lighter
type best represented by the example from Tenea. In the former,
with their big heads and shoulders and their powerful arms and legs,
we may see early boxers or pancratiasts; in the latter a long-limbed
runner, with powerful chest, but slim and supple legs. In the <i>Apollo
of Tenea</i> there is no flabbiness nor softness, and yet no emaciation.
We see very similar runners on Panathenaic vases. Between the two
extremes we have a long series, those from Mount Ptoion and elsewhere.</p>

<p>We do not doubt that the early statues of athletes at Olympia showed
all the variations we have discussed in these “Apollos.” Of this type,
then, were the statues at Olympia of the Spartan Eutelidas, the oldest
mentioned by Pausanias,<a id="FNanchor_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">841</a> those of Phrikias of Pelinna in Thessaly,<a id="FNanchor_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">842</a>
and of Phanas of Pellene in Achæa,<a id="FNanchor_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">843</a> to whom, later on in this chapter,
we shall ascribe the two archaic marble helmeted heads found at
Olympia (Fig. <a href="#f30">30</a>), the wooden statues of Praxidamas and Rhexibios,<a id="FNanchor_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">844</a>
the statue of Kylon on the Akropolis of Athens,<a id="FNanchor_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">845</a> and that of Hetoimokles
at Sparta.<a id="FNanchor_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">846</a> The statue of the famous wrestler Milo of Kroton by
the sculptor Dameas, mentioned by Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">847</a> and described by Philostratos,<a id="FNanchor_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">848</a>
must also have conformed with the “Apollo” type, though it
showed a step in advance of the earlier ones by having its arms bent
at the elbow, the forearms being extended horizontally outward. This
statue needs a somewhat detailed account. The description of Philostratos
seems to have been founded on the account in Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">849</a> of Milo’s
prowess, which, in turn, may have arisen from the appearance of the
statue and the cicerone’s description. Philostratos says that it stood on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
a quoit with the feet close together and with the left hand grasping a
pomegranate, the fingers of the right hand being extended straight out,
and a fillet encircling the brows.<a id="FNanchor_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">850</a> Philostratos has Apollonios explain
the attributes of the statue on the ground that the people of Kroton
represented their famous victor in the guise of a priest of Hera. This
would explain the priestly fillet and the pomegranate sacred to the goddess,
while the diskos, on which the statue rested, would be the shield
on which Hera’s priest stood when praying. Scherer, however, rightly
pointed out that the statue in the Altis was of Milo the victor and not
the priest. He therefore explained the diskos<a id="FNanchor_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">851</a> merely as a round
basis on which the statue, of the archaic “Apollo” type with its feet
close together, stood, and the <i>tainia</i> as a victor band. He followed
Philostratos in believing that the gesture of the right hand was one of
adoration.<a id="FNanchor_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">852</a> He looked upon the object in the left hand not as a
pomegranate at all, but as an alabastron, a toilet article adapted to
a victor. He, therefore, believed that the <i>Apollo</i> of the elder Kanachos
of Sikyon,<a id="FNanchor_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">853</a> the so-called <i>Philesian Apollo</i>,<a id="FNanchor_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">854</a> represented nude and holding
a tiny fawn in the right hand and a bow in the left, would give a good
idea of the pose of Milo’s statue.<a id="FNanchor_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">855</a> Hitzig and Bluemner believe this
explanation of Scherer probable, although they rightly disagree with him
in his exchanging the pomegranate for an alabastron, since Pausanias
expressly mentions a pomegranate in the hand of another victor statue
at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">856</a> Pliny speaks of a male figure by Pythagoras, <i>mala ferentem
nudum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">857</a> and Lucian says apples were prizes at Delphi,<a id="FNanchor_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">858</a> and we
know that Milo was also a Pythian victor. The same commentators believe
that Pausanias’ story of Milo bursting a cord drawn round his brow
by swelling his veins arose from the victor band on the statue, and the
story of the strength of his fingers from the position of the fingers on it.</p>

<p>We have seen in the “Apollo” statues a considerable variety of physical
types. In the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> the artist was feeling his way and
was hampered by local school tendencies. At first he knew only how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
to produce rigid statues in the conventional Egyptian attitude with
the arms glued to the sides, the two halves of the body being symmetrical
and the hips on the same level. He gradually improved on this
<span class="figright200">

model, making the position more elastic—as
in the statue of Milo—rightly indicating
bones and muscles and giving to the figure
natural proportions. Bulle has shown on
one plate<a id="FNanchor_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">859</a> three statuettes which illustrate
the improvements reached in bronze in various
parts of Greece by the end of the sixth
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> To the left is represented a
victorious palæstra gymnast—as is indicated

the Akropolis Museum (Fig. <a href="#f15">15</a>);<a id="FNanchor_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">860</a> in the
center is the Payne Knight statuette of the
British Museum,<a id="FNanchor_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">861</a> carrying a fawn in the
right hand, which is a copy of the <i>Philesian
Apollo</i> which stood in the Didymaion near
Miletos; to the right is Hermes with the
petasos, short-girded tunic, and winged sandals,
holding a ram in the left and probably
a kerykeion in the right hand.<a id="FNanchor_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">862</a> The attributes
of the three, then, attest respectively
a victor, Apollo, and Hermes. In all three
the arms are freed from the body, and the
muscles of the breast, chest, and abdomen
are indicated, though carelessly in the case
of the victor. The proportions of the three
vary greatly; the Attic victor has a large
head, broad shoulders, powerful chest, long
body, and short legs; the <i>Apollo</i> has long
legs, shorter though slimmer body, and small head;<a id="FNanchor_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">863</a> the <i>Hermes</i> has
a clearly outlined figure and shows the careful modeling so characteristic
of the schools of Argos and Sikyon in the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>
Bulle shows that the further development of the “Apollo” type was
halted by the Argive school, which, while continuing the restful pose
of these figures, counteracted their rigidity by inclining the head to
the side and throwing the weight unevenly on the legs by lowering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
one hip and further advancing one foot. The central line was no
longer vertical, but curved, and it was now possible to give greater
detail to chest and abdomen. Polykleitos finally perfected this curve
and threw back the left foot, resting the weight of the body on the
right—from which time on we have the regular scheme of “free”
and “rest” legs. Despite all these later improvements, Olympic victors
continued to set up statues in the rest attitude of the “Apollo”
type down perhaps into the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> Such dedications
were the result both of school tendencies and economy, especially in
the case of equestrian victors, who frequently were content to use such
“actionless” statues in place of groups. We have only to mention
the monuments of Timon of Elis, whose statue was the work of the
Sikyonian Daidalos,<a id="FNanchor_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">864</a> and of Telemachos of Elis, whose statue was
made by the otherwise unknown sculptor Philonides.<a id="FNanchor_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">865</a></p>

<p>Before systematically considering victor statues at Olympia and
elsewhere with general motives, <i>i. e.</i>, represented at rest, we shall now
rapidly sketch the development of athletic sculpture in four great
centres, Argos, Sikyon, Aegina, and Athens, even though some of the
works mentioned were represented in motion. Sculptors of other
schools known at Olympia will be treated incidentally in both this and
the following chapters.</p>

<h3>THE AFFILIATED SCHOOLS OF ARGOS AND SIKYON.</h3>

<p>While in general it is unprofitable to discuss sculptors who have not
surely left any example of their art behind, there are two early schools
of Peloponnesian sculpture, those of Argos and Sikyon, which, though
we may assign work to them only by conjecture, can not be summarily
passed over, owing to their great importance in the history of Greek
athletic art. The bronze used in their works was too valuable to
escape the barbarians, and, furthermore, the monotony, which must
have characterized early Peloponnesian sculpture, militated against
these works being reproduced to any great degree by later copyists.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The School of Argos.</span></h4>

<p>The Argive school was devoted mainly to athletic statuary. The
greatest name in old Argive art is that of Ageladas or Hagelaïdas,<a id="FNanchor_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">866</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>the reputed teacher of Myron and Polykleitos, who lived from the third
quarter of the sixth century into the second quarter of the fifth century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> While his connection with Myron and Polykleitos is scarcely
to be doubted,<a id="FNanchor_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">867</a> his supposed connection with Pheidias has made the
chronology of the life of this sculptor one of the difficult problems of the
ancient history of art. A scholion on Aristophanes’ <i>Ranae</i>, 504, dates
the statue known as the <i>Herakles Alexikakos</i> in the Attic deme Melite
by Hagelaïdas after the pestilence in Athens of 431–430 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, and makes
the Argive sculptor (Gelados = Hagelaïdas) the teacher of Pheidias.
As his statue of the Olympic victor Anochos commemorated a victory
won in Ol. 65 (&#8239;=&#8239;520 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), this late date is manifestly impossible.<a id="FNanchor_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">868</a>
Furthermore, a better tradition says that Hegias was the teacher of the
Attic master.<a id="FNanchor_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">869</a> Furtwaengler’s attempt to show that these two divergent
traditions were really in accord, by the assumption that Hegias
was the pupil of Hagelaïdas and that his art came from the latter—thus
explaining certain similarities in the work of Hagelaïdas and Pheidias,—does
not solve the problem.<a id="FNanchor_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">870</a> As the scholion is based on a good
tradition,<a id="FNanchor_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">871</a> the best solution of the difficulty is that of Kalkmann<a id="FNanchor_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">872</a> and
others, that the <i>Alexikakos</i> was the work of a younger Hagelaïdas, the
grandson of the famous master, by the intermediate Argeiadas. For
a lower limit to the activity of Hagelaïdas there seems to be no good
reason for distrusting the evidence that he made a bronze <i>Zeus</i> for the
Messenians to be set up at Naupaktos, whither they moved in 455 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">873</a>
This makes quite possible a period of collaboration of four or five years
at least between Polykleitos and Hagelaïdas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<p>Pausanias mentions the monuments of three victors at Olympia by
Hagelaïdas: the statues of the pancratiast Timasitheos of Delphi, who
won two victories some time between Ols. (?) 65 and 67 (520 and 512
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>);<a id="FNanchor_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">874</a> of the runner Anochos of Tarentum, who won in the stade- and
double-race in Ols. 65 and (?) 66 (&#8239;=&#8239;520 and 516 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>);<a id="FNanchor_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">875</a> and the chariot-group
of Kleosthenes of Epidamnos, who won in Ol. 66 (&#8239;=&#8239;516 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">876</a></p>

<p>None of the works of Hagelaïdas at Olympia or elsewhere is known.
Messenian coins of the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> show the motives of two of
his statues, that of his <i>Zeus Ithomatas</i> just mentioned as being made for
the Messenians,<a id="FNanchor_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">877</a> and the beardless <i>Zeus</i> παῖς at Aigion.<a id="FNanchor_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">878</a> However,
we infer the characteristics of his style from the bronze statuette in
Berlin which was found at Ligourió near Epidauros (Fig. <a href="#f16">16</a>).<a id="FNanchor_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">879</a> This
is undoubtedly an Argive work contemporary with the later period
of Hagelaïdas. Furtwaengler and Frost are right in looking upon it
as showing the prototype of the canon of Polykleitos. Though too
small to count as a characteristic work of the early Argive school, it
shows us that the style of that school was a short and stocky type,
similar to Aeginetan works, only somewhat fleshier and heavier. The
straight mouth and heavy chin, the treatment of the eyelids, and the
clumsy limbs are all archaic features to be expected in the period preceding
Polykleitos. The modeling is carefully executed, showing a
knowledge of anatomy. If such excellence is found in a statuette, we
can form some idea of the perfection of a statue by the master.</p>

</div>

<p>The bronze <i>Apollo</i> from Pompeii now in the Naples Museum,<a id="FNanchor_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">880</a> with
marble replicas in Mantua and Paris,<a id="FNanchor_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">881</a> shows us how Hagelaïdas treated
a god type, while the statue of an athlete by Stephanos will give us
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
some idea of how he treated his victor statues, as it seems to have been
modeled after an athlete statue of the early fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, perhaps
after a work by some pupil of the master. Stephanos belonged to the
school of Pasiteles, a group of sculptors flourishing at Rome at the end of
the Republic and the beginning of the Empire. They devoted themselves
to the reproduction of early fifth-century statues. They were not
ordinary copyists, for their works show individual mannerisms and a system
of proportions foreign to the originals. Thus their statues have the
square shoulders of the Argive school, but the slim bodies and slender legs
of the period of Lysippos and his scholars. Apart from such mannerisms,
then, in the male figure signed <i>Stephanos, pupil of Pasiteles</i>,
in the Villa Albani in Rome (Pl. <a href="#p9">9</a>),<a id="FNanchor_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">882</a> which reappears in a very similar
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
statue in groups combined with a female figure of related style,<a id="FNanchor_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">883</a> or
with another male figure,<a id="FNanchor_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">884</a> we may see a copy of a bronze original
of the Argive school before Polykleitos. The standing motive and the
body forms are the same in both the Mantuan <i>Apollo</i> and the Stephanos
figure, although the former is more developed and the head type is
different in both; this shows that the two, while displaying the same
basic ideal, were not works of the same master.<a id="FNanchor_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">885</a> As the statue by
Stephanos has a fillet around the hair, it may well represent an ideal
athlete, who in the original held an aryballos or similar palæstra
attribute in the raised left hand. It is interesting to compare the copies
of this group with those of another representing mother and son, the
work of Menelaos, the pupil of Stephanos, which, though transferred
from Greek to Roman taste in respect of drapery and forms, is merely
a variation of the same theme without any heroic traits.<a id="FNanchor_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">886</a></p>

<p>The influence of Hagelaïdas can be easily traced in other schools
of art, especially in the Attic School and in the sculptures of the temple
of Zeus at Olympia, whether these latter be Peloponnesian in origin
or not. It will be convenient in this connection to discuss briefly the
style of these important sculptures, which we have already mentioned
several times. The statement of Pausanias,<a id="FNanchor_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">887</a> that the sculptors of the
East and West Gables were Paionios of Mende in Thrace and Alkamenes
respectively—the latter being known as the pupil of Pheidias<a id="FNanchor_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">888</a>—was
not doubted until the discovery of the Olympia sculptures.<a id="FNanchor_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">889</a>
Then doubts arose both on chronological and stylistic grounds, and
now only a few archæologists would maintain that either artist had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
anything to do with these groups. The style of the two gables (as
well as that of the metopes) is so similar that many have assigned them
to one and the same artist.<a id="FNanchor_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">890</a> They have been referred to many schools
from Ionia to Sicily, even including a local Elean one. Thus Brunn
assigned them to a North Greek-Thracian school; Flasch<a id="FNanchor_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">891</a> and (more
recently) Joubin<a id="FNanchor_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">892</a> to the Attic; Kekulé<a id="FNanchor_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">893</a> and Friedrichs-Wolters<a id="FNanchor_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">894</a> to a

<p>To return to the art of Hagelaïdas: if we assume that the Ligourió
bronze comes from the school of that Argive master certain conclusions
must be drawn. The figure is archaic, but does not have the archaic
smile. In Athens at the end of the archaic period there was a reaction
against this smile, and doubtless the Athenian artists were strongly
influenced by Argive models. Thus an archaic bronze head of a youth,
found on the Akropolis and dating from about 480 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, shows a serious
mouth, a strong chin, heavy upper eyelids, and finely worked hair,
characteristics which we found in the Ligourió statuette. These
traits show that the statuette and the head were the forerunners of the
<i>Apollo</i> of the West Gable at Olympia. So finished a bronze as this
one from the Akropolis, at the beginning of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, has
inclined Richardson to look upon it as “not improbably a work of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
Hagelaïdas,”<a id="FNanchor_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">902</a> though here again Furtwaengler would ascribe it to
Hegias.<a id="FNanchor_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">903</a> The Parian marble statue of an ephebe found on the Akropolis
(Fig. <a href="#f17">17</a>)<a id="FNanchor_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">904</a>—one of the most beautiful recovered during the excavations

there—shows the same Argive influence.
This statue is chronologically the first
masterpiece, thus far recovered, which marks
the break with archaism by having its head
turned slightly to one side.<a id="FNanchor_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">905</a> It has the
same pose as the <i>Athlete</i> by Stephanos and
probably represents a palæstra victor. The
head, with its heavy chin, and the muscular
body strikingly resemble the <i>Harmodios</i> (Fig.
32), which has led Furtwaengler and others
to ascribe it to Kritios or his school.<a id="FNanchor_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">906</a> At
the same time a similarity is seen between
this head and that of the <i>Apollo</i> of the West
Gable at Olympia, and so with Bulle and
others we ascribe it to the Argive school.</p>

<p>One of the female statues (<i>Korai</i>) found on
the Akropolis, and approximately of the
same date as the ephebe, viz, the fragmentary
one consisting of head and bust and known
popularly as <i>la petite boudeuse</i>, shows the
same revolt against Ionism.<a id="FNanchor_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">907</a> In many
respects this statue is very different from
most of the other Akropolis <i>Korai</i>. The
eyes are not yet set back naturally, but the
appearance of depth is attained by thicken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>ing
the eyelids, quite in contrast with the modeling of the eyeball
in most of the other statues. The corners of the mouth turn down,
which gives it the appearance of pouting. This statue is also our first
example in sculpture of the so-called Greek profile—the nose continuing
the line of the forehead. The same Argive influence in Athenian art is
also discernible in the Parian marble head of an athlete with traces of
yellow in the hair (Fig. <a href="#f18">18</a>),<a id="FNanchor_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">908</a> which may be dated a little later than the
Akropolis ephebe—about 470 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> Because of its resemblance to the
<span class="figright300"><a id="f18"></a>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span>—Head of an Ephebe, from the

<i>Apollo</i> of Olympia, its Attic-Peloponnesian
origin seems
clear.<a id="FNanchor_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">909</a> Its expression is comparable
with that of the <i>Kore</i>
just discussed—as it has the
same mouth, eyes, and nose,
both monuments showing the
reaction against the archaic
smile, which characterized the
Ionian period of Attic art.
This same Ionic reaction also
may be seen in the bronze
statuette of a diskobolos in the
Metropolitan Museum (Fig.
46),<a id="FNanchor_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">910</a> which resembles in style
that of the <i>Tyrannicides</i>, but
shows also Argive traits.
These Argive traits, small
head and slender limbs, are
easily seen by comparing this
statuette with the Ligourió
bronze.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned
the monumental group of the
hoplite victor Damaretos and of the pentathlete Theopompos, which
was made about 500 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> by the Argive sculptors Chrysothemis and
Eutelidas.<a id="FNanchor_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">911</a> These artists were known to later antiquity only by the
epigram inscribed on the base of this monument at Olympia, and the
probable dates of the two victories of Theopompos, Ols. (?) 69 and
70 (&#8239;=&#8239;504 and 500 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), show that they were contemporaries of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Hagelaïdas, and not, as formerly was believed, the forerunners of his
school.<a id="FNanchor_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">912</a></p>

<p>Polykleitos, a Sikyonian by birth,<a id="FNanchor_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">913</a> migrated early to Argos to
become the pupil of Hagelaïdas, and became the great master of the
Argive school in the next generation after him. We have four statues
by him at Olympia. His earliest work probably was the statue of the
boxer Kyniskos of Mantinea, who won in Ol. (?) 80 (&#8239;=&#8239;460 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>); he
made the statues of the Elean pentathlete Pythokles and of the Epidamnian
boxer Aristion, both of whom won their victories in Ol. 82 (&#8239;=&#8239;452
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>); and lastly he made the statue of the boy boxer Thersilochos from
Kerkyra, who won in Ol. (?) 87 (&#8239;=&#8239;432 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>)<a id="FNanchor_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">914</a> The footprints on the
three recovered bases of the statues of the first three show that all were
represented at rest. Of Patrokles, the brother of Polykleitos, Pausanias
mentions no statues at Olympia, though Pliny says that he made athlete
statues.<a id="FNanchor_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">915</a> Of Naukydes,<a id="FNanchor_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">916</a> the nephew or brother of Polykleitos, we have
record of three athlete statues at Olympia: those of the wrestlers Cheimon
of Argos, who won in Ol. 83 (&#8239;=&#8239;448 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), and Baukis of Trœzen,
who won some time between Ols. (?) 85 and 90 (&#8239;=&#8239;440 and 420 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>);
also one of the boxer Eukles of Rhodes, who won some time between
Ols. 90 and 93 (&#8239;=&#8239;420 and 408 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">917</a> A contemporary of Naukydes
was the sculptor Phradmon, who, according to Pliny, was a contemporary
of Polykleitos;<a id="FNanchor_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">918</a> he made the statue of the boy wrestler Amertas
of Elis, who won a victory some time between Ols. 84 and 90 (&#8239;=&#8239;444
and 420 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">919</a> In the next century, Polykleitos Minor, the grandson
or grandnephew of the great Polykleitos, and the pupil of Naukydes,<a id="FNanchor_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">920</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
had three statues at Olympia: those of the boy boxer Antipatros of
Miletos, whose victory is given by Africanus as Ol. 98 (&#8239;=&#8239;388 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>);
of the two boy wrestlers Agenor of Thebes, who won some time between
Ols. 93 and 103 (&#8239;=&#8239;408 and 368 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), and Xenokles of Mainalos, who
won some time between Ols. 94 and 100 (&#8239;=&#8239;404 and 380 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">921</a> The
inscribed base of the latter has been recovered and the footprints
show that the statue was represented at rest, the body resting equally
on both feet, the left slightly advanced. Andreas, a second-century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>
Argive sculptor, made a statue at Olympia of the boy wrestler Lysippos
of Elis, who won some time between Ols. 149 and 157 (&#8239;=&#8239;184 and 152
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">922</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The School of Sikyon.</span></h4>

<p>The Sikyonian school of bronze founders was closely affiliated with
the one at Argos. Early in the archaic period the brothers Dipoinos
and Skyllis, sons or pupils of the mythical Daidalos of Crete, migrated
to Sikyon.<a id="FNanchor_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">923</a> A generation later another Cretan sculptor, Aristokles,
founded there an artist family which lasted through seven or eight
generations.<a id="FNanchor_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">924</a> His two grandsons Aristokles and Kanachos are known
to have collaborated with Hagelaïdas on a group of three Muses.<a id="FNanchor_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">925</a>
Many have seen in the small bronze found in the sea off Piombino,
Tuscany, and now in the Louvre (Fig. <a href="#f19">19</a>),<a id="FNanchor_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">926</a> a copy of the <i>Apollo Philesios</i>,
the best-known work of Kanachos. This gem of the bronze
art, in true archaic style, may very well represent the <i>Apollo</i>, which,
according to the description of Pliny<a id="FNanchor_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">927</a> and the evidence of Milesian
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
copper coins of all periods,<a id="FNanchor_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">928</a>
had as attributes a fawn in the outstretched
right hand and a bow in the left. However, Overbeck,<a id="FNanchor_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">929</a> followed by von
Mach, believes that it is not a copy of Kanachos’ <i>Apollo</i>, but merely
<span class="figright200"><a id="f19"></a>
<img src="images/i_p119.jpg" width="200" height="440" alt="Bronze Statuette
of Apollo." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span>—Bronze Statuette
of Apollo, found in the Sea
off Piombino. Louvre,
Paris.</span></span>
represents a boy assisting at a sacrifice,
and that the original held a cup in the
left hand and a saucer in the right. In
any case the statuette is too inaccurate to
give us more than the pose of the <i>Apollo</i>
of Kanachos, even if it were proved to be
a copy. It may be merely a reproduction
of the mythological type of Apollo, which
the artist himself followed, and so we can
not say definitely to what school it belongs.
The Payne Knight bronze in the
British Museum,<a id="FNanchor_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">930</a> which holds a tiny fawn
in the right hand, the bow originally in the
left hand being lost, has better pretensions,
perhaps, to be a copy of the <i>Apollo</i>. Another
archaic half life-size bronze, formerly
in the Palazzo Sciarra,<a id="FNanchor_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">931</a> is of a similar type,
though its style is different. Another
bronze statuette from Naxos, now in Berlin,<a id="FNanchor_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">932</a>
shows the same position of the hands,
but has an aryballos or pomegranate in the
right hand. We have already classed it as
an example of the conversion of an original
god-type into that of a victor. We might
also mention the mutilated torso found by
Holleaux at the sanctuary of Apollo Ptoios
in Bœotia (Fig. <a href="#f12">12</a>, right), which has a
similar pose to that of the statuette from
Piombino, and whose hair technique shows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
that it is an imitation of a bronze work.<a id="FNanchor_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">933</a> However, as we shall see
later, it may be rather representative of the Aeginetan school of sculptors.
All these works may tell us of the general character of the
<i>Apollo</i>, but little of its style.<a id="FNanchor_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">934</a></p>

<p>No athlete statue by Aristokles or his brother Kanachos is known
to have stood at Olympia. That the latter actually made victor
statues, however, is proved by Pliny’s statement (<i>l. c.</i>) that he made
<i>celetizontas pueros</i>. Of the later Sikyonian school we have twenty-seven
statues of victors made by eleven different sculptors, whose dates
range from near the end of the fourth down into the third century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, of whom we shall give a chronological list. Alypos, the pupil
of the Argive Naukydes, had four statues at Olympia: those of the
wrestler Symmachos of Elis, of the boy boxer Neolaïdas of Pheneus, of
the boy wrestler Archedamos of Elis, and of the boy and man wrestler
Euthymenes of Mainalos, all of whom must have won their victories
some time between Ols. 94 and 104 (&#8239;=&#8239;404 and 364 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">935</a> Kanachos,
the Younger, made one statue, that of the boy boxer Bykelos of Sikyon,
who won some time between Ols. 92 and 105 (&#8239;=&#8239;412 and 360 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">936</a>
Olympos made the statue of the pancratiast Xenophon of Aigion, who
won some time between Ols. 95 and 105 (&#8239;=&#8239;400 and 360 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">937</a> The
sculptor Daidalos, the son and pupil of Patrokles, and probably the
nephew of Polykleitos, made four monuments for four victors: the
equestrian group of the Elean charioteer Timon and his son Aigyptos, a
victor in horse-racing, and statues of the Elean wrestler Aristodemos
and the stade-runner Eupolemos. Their victories fell between Ols. 96
and 103 (&#8239;=&#8239;396 and 368 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">938</a> Damokritos made the statue of the Elean
boy boxer Hippos, who won between Ols. 96 and 107 (&#8239;=&#8239;396 and 352 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">939</a>
Kleon had five statues credited to him, all but one being of boy victors:
those of the boy runner Deinolochos of Elis, the pentathlete Hysmon
of Elis, the two boy boxers Kritodamos, and of Alketos of Kleitor, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
of the boy runner Lykinos of Heraia. Their victories fell between Ols.
94 and 103 (&#8239;=&#8239;404 and 368 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">940</a> The great Lysippos had the same
number of victor statues as Kleon, and also two honor statues at Olympia:
those of the equestrian victor Troilos of Elis, of the Akarnanian pancratiast
Philandridas, of the wrestler Cheilon of Patrai, of the pancratiast
Polydamas of Skotoussa, and of the hoplite-runner Kallikrates.
Their victories occurred between Ols. 102 and 115 (&#8239;=&#8239;372 and 320 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">941</a>
The son of Lysippos, Daïppos, made two statues, one for the Elean
boy boxer Kallon and the other for the Elean Nikandros, who won the
double foot-race. Their victories fell within the activity of the sculptor,
Ols. 115 and 125 (&#8239;=&#8239;320 and 280 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">942</a> Daitondas made the statue of
the Elean boy boxer Theotimos, who won his victory some time between
Ols. 116 and 120 (&#8239;=&#8239;316 and 300 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">943</a> Eutychides, the most famous
pupil of Lysippos, famed alike as a bronze founder, statuary, and painter,
carved the statue of the boy runner Timosthenes of Elis, who won some
time between Ols. 115 and 125 (&#8239;=&#8239;320 and 280 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">944</a> Pliny gives Ol.
121 (&#8239;=&#8239;296 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>) as the <i>floruit</i> of this sculptor, which was probably
the date of the erection of his most famous work, the colossal bronze
<i>Tyche</i>, as tutelary deity of the city of Antioch on the Orontes, which
was founded by Seleukos I in Ol. 119.3 (&#8239;=&#8239;302 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">945</a> This shows that
Eutychides was already by that date a famed sculptor, having begun<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
his career by 330–320 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> Kantharos, the pupil of Eutychides,
made the statues of the two boy wrestlers Kratinos of Aigira and
Alexinikos of Elis, who won their victories some time between Ols.
120 and 130 (&#8239;=&#8239;300 and 260 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">946</a></p>

<h3>ÆGINETAN SCULPTORS.</h3>

<p>We have but little left of the prominent early Aeginetan school
of bronze sculptors. Of Kallon, the earliest historical sculptor of the
school, the reputed pupil of Tektaios and Angelion (who in turn were
the pupils of Dipoinos and Skyllis), we have only literary evidence.
He was typical of archaic severity just prior to the era of transition,
and therefore should be compared with Hegias of Athens and Kanachos
of Sikyon. For Onatas, the most famous of the Aeginetan sculptors,
whose <i>floruit</i> was in the first half of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, we have
evidence of many monuments at Olympia. Besides the colossal
<i>Herakles</i> dedicated by the Thasians,<a id="FNanchor_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">947</a> a <i>Hermes</i> dedicated by the
people of Pheneus,<a id="FNanchor_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">948</a> and a large group of nine statues of Greek heroes
standing on a curved base faced by a statue of Nestor on another, the
group being dedicated by the Achaians,<a id="FNanchor_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">949</a> he made a chariot and charioteer
to commemorate the victory of Hiero of Syracuse at Olympia in
468 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, for which monument Kalamis furnished two horses.<a id="FNanchor_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">950</a> Glaukias
made a bronze chariot for Hiero’s brother Gelo of Gela, who later
became tyrant of Syracuse, and who won a chariot victory in Ol. 73
(&#8239;=&#8239;488 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">951</a> This sculptor also excelled in fashioning statues of
boxers and pancratiasts, making the monuments of the boxers Philon
of Kerkyra and Glaukos of Karystos, and that of the renowned boxer
and pancratiast Theagenes of Thasos.<a id="FNanchor_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">952</a> The statue of Glaukos was
represented in the schema of one “sparring” (σκιαμαχῶν),<a id="FNanchor_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">953</a> and so
was in movement and not at rest. We have athlete statues by three
other Aeginetan sculptors at Olympia. Thus Ptolichos, the pupil of
the Sikyonian Aristokles, set up statues of the Aeginetan boy wrestler
Theognetos, who won in Ol. 76 (&#8239;=&#8239;476 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), and of the boy boxer
Epikradios of Mantinea, who won between Ols. (?) 72 and 74 (&#8239;=&#8239;492 and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
484 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>);<a id="FNanchor_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">954</a> Serambos made the statue of the boy boxer Agiadas of Elis,
who won between Ols. (?) 72 and 74;<a id="FNanchor_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">955</a> Philotimos made the horse for the
horse-racing victory of Xenombrotos of Kos, who won in Ol. (?) 83 (&#8239;=&#8239;448
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">956</a> All of these sculptors appear to have used bronze exclusively,
and their art, though independent, showed a bias toward Peloponnesian
work. There are few examples left of this art. The bronze head of a
bearded warrior or hoplite victor found on the Akropolis, if we are justified
in classing it as Aeginetan and not Attic, shows the excellence which
we associate with this school.<a id="FNanchor_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">957</a> The delicate execution of its hair and
beard, as well as the strength and precision of this head, makes it not
unworthy of being ascribed to one of the best artists of the school,
perhaps to Onatas himself. The beardless bronze head discovered in
1756 in the villa of the Pisos in Herculaneum, now in Naples, has
also been assigned to Onatas, as its features are similar to those of the
one under discussion.<a id="FNanchor_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">958</a> The Tux bronze statuette of a hoplitodrome,
to be discussed in Ch. IV (Fig. <a href="#f42">42</a>), has also been assigned to an Aeginetan
master.<a id="FNanchor_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">959</a> The marble statue known as the <i>Strangford Apollo</i> in
the British Museum, already mentioned (Fig. <a href="#f14">14</a>),<a id="FNanchor_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">960</a> may show the characteristics
of the early school in marble, though it is impossible to say
whether it is a copy of a bronze original or a minor work in stone under
Aeginetan influence. The smaller “Apollo” from Mount Ptoion, already
discussed (Fig. <a href="#f13">13</a>, right),<a id="FNanchor_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">961</a> appears to show in exaggerated form the same
Aeginetan traits. However, we get out best notion of Aeginetan work
in marble from the gable statues in the Munich Museum, representing
Homeric warriors fighting, which adorned the temple of Aphaia in the
northeastern corner of the island. Their importance in this connection
calls for a brief account of them.</p>

<p>Since the discovery of these groups by an international party of
Englishmen and Germans in 1811, and their restoration soon after their
arrival in Munich by the sculptor Thorwaldsen, many new fragments
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
have been discovered by Furtwaengler during his excavations of the
temple site in 1901, and have been incorporated into the existing figures
in the Glyptothek. His reconstruction, though not definitive, is more
in accord with artistic probability than any that preceded.<a id="FNanchor_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">962</a> As we
should expect from the athletic tradition of the Aeginetan school of
sculpture just outlined, these sculptures represent finely trained nude
athletes, whose modeling shows great observation of nature, especially
in the treatment of muscles and veins. In fact it has been truly said
that anatomical knowledge was never expressed again in Greek art so
simply and naturally. The figures, without any excess of flesh, are
slightly under life-size, short and stocky—shoulders square, but the
waists slender and the legs long in proportion to the bodies—and withal
are very compact and full of strength. The figures of the two pediments
differ slightly, the eastern being more developed than the western.
Brunn, long ago, arguing from the stele of Aristion, which then
was the best example extant of archaic Attic art, showed how that
art was characterized by grace and dignity of effect, while Aeginetan
art was characterized by a finer study of nature. This generalization
is no longer a matter of inference, but of knowledge.</p>

<p>These groups represent the highest period of Aeginetan art. They
have been dated anywhere from the end of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> down
to a period after the battle of Salamis.<a id="FNanchor_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">963</a> Probably a date just after that
battle is correct, as Aeginetans won prizes of valor there.<a id="FNanchor_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">964</a> Any attempt
to assign them to this or that artist is merely conjectural. The
general similarity in subject to that of the Delphi group by Onatas,
which represented the death in battle of Opis, the king of the barbarian
Iapygians, at the hands of the Tarentines,<a id="FNanchor_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">965</a> and the group at Olympia
already mentioned as representing a Trojan subject, led earlier scholars
to assign the slightly more advanced statues of the East Pediment to
Onatas and the more archaic ones of the West Pediment to Kallon. But
we know both these sculptors only as bronze workers. The violent action
of some of the figures reminds us at once of Pausanias’ description of the
statue of the boxer Glaukos by the sculptor Glaukias, which we have
already mentioned. But on the whole, though they are violent, the
slight proportions of these athletic figures do not fit the appearance of
boxers and pancratiasts, which, as we have seen, formed the staple of
Aeginetan sculptors, but rather those of runners. We see a good
wrestler in the <i>Snatcher</i> of the East Gable (Fig. <a href="#f20">20</a>),<a id="FNanchor_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">966</a> and the corre<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>sponding

the West gable (Fig. <a href="#f21">21</a>, left),<a id="FNanchor_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">968</a> of the finest Parian marble, represented
as lunging forward, pressing on the enemy armed with helm, spear,
and shield, would pass as a good example of a hoplitodrome, far freer
and more individual than the warrior from Dodona.</p>

<h3>ATTIC SCULPTORS.</h3>

<p>Owing to the Persian sack of the Athenian Akropolis in 480 and 479
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, and the subsequent burial of works of art there and their rediscovery
by the excavations of 1885–1889, we know more of archaic Attic
sculpture (600–480 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>) than of any other early school.<a id="FNanchor_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">969</a> We have
already mentioned certain Attic works which show the influence of
the severer Argive school—<i>la petite boudeuse</i>, the head of the yellow-haired
ephebe (Fig. <a href="#f18">18</a>), the Akropolis athlete statue (Fig. <a href="#f17">17</a>), etc.—which
was prominent at the beginning of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, works
which can be attributed to Hegias, Kritios, and their associates. They
illustrate the reaction against Ionic taste, an influence which came
from Asia Minor and the islands, especially after the fall of the Lydian
Empire of Crœsus, and which for a time submerged native Attic art.
This Ionic art was characterized by great technical ability, and by
rich draperies and decorative effect. The archaic smile was its special
feature. Ionism is best represented by some of the Akropolis <i>Korai</i>.<a id="FNanchor_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">970</a>
In athletic art we see Ionism at its flood tide in the Rampin head found
in Athens in 1877, now in the Louvre, which corresponds in style
with some of the earlier female statues of the Akropolis.<a id="FNanchor_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">971</a> This head
has a more elaborate frisure than any of the female heads and, in fact,
the elaborate treatment of the hair of the crown and forehead is more
suitable to a female than a male statue. The beard is carefully plaited,
while traces of red seem to show that the mustache was painted on.
Similar traces of color appear on the beard and hair. The smiling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
mouth, high ears, and almond eyes recall many archaic works, but
especially the <i>Apollo of Tenea</i> (Pl. <a href="#p8A">8A</a>). The garland of oak leaves
above the frisure of the forehead may suggest a victor,<a id="FNanchor_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">972</a> or perhaps a
priest or assistant on some religious embassy.<a id="FNanchor_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">973</a> The turning of the
neck—as in the ephebe statue of the Akropolis (Fig. <a href="#f17">17</a>)—shows a break
at this early time with archaism. Another work illustrating Ionism is
the fragment of a grave-stele found near the Dipylon gate in 1873 and
dating from the second half of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">974</a> It represents
the head of an athlete in profile, the youth holding a diskos in his left
hand, so placed that his head is projected upon it in relief as on a nimbus.
The top of the head is broken off, but we see the usual archaic
features in the face—the almond-shaped eye (in profile), big nose with
knob-like nostrils, thick lips with the archaic smile, retreating chin and
forehead, and high ear with a huge lobe. The neck and chin, however,
are full of grace and strength, as is also the slender thumb outlined
against the diskos. As the stele broadens downward,<a id="FNanchor_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">975</a> the figure appears
to have been represented with the feet apart, and so may have
represented a palæstra diskobolos on parade,<a id="FNanchor_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">976</a> and is, therefore, our
earliest representation of such an athlete. A similar dress-parade pose
is seen on the stele of Aristion in the National Museum at Athens, the
work of the sculptor Aristokles, which represents a warrior with a
spear in the left hand.<a id="FNanchor_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">977</a> Another torso of an ephebe in the Akropolis
Museum represents Ionic work from Paros.<a id="FNanchor_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">978</a> Another head, the so-called
Rayet head in the Jakobsen collection in Copenhagen, one of
the most remarkable specimens of Greek archaic art<a id="FNanchor_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">979</a> (Fig. <a href="#f22">22</a>), <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
somewhat later in date than the Rampin head, represents quite a different
tendency in Attic art. While the Rampin head represents Ionic
influence, this head represents pure Attic work untrammeled by foreign
influence, a true development of the old Attic sculpture in <i>poros</i>,
<span class="figright250"><a id="f22"></a>
<img src="images/i_p128.jpg" width="250" height="321" alt="Archaic Marble Head
of a Youth." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span>—Archaic Marble Head
of a Youth. Jakobsen Collection,
Ny-Carlsberg Museum, Copenhagen.</span></span>
the best examples of which are to be
found in the decorative sculptures of
the Old Temple of Athena on the Akropolis,
enlarged by the Peisistratidai.
Comparing it with the head of the
<i>Athena</i> of the gable of that temple,<a id="FNanchor_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">980</a>
we see great similarity in the simple execution
and reserve in the treatment of
details—characteristics of pure Attic
sculpture—especially in the deep lines
on either side of the mouth in the Jakobsen
head. The hair is pictorially treated
like a cap, traces of red appearing on it
as well as on the lips and eyes. The
Copenhagen and Rampin heads, together
with the famous portrait head
in the old Sabouroff collection,<a id="FNanchor_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">981</a> and the
head of a woman in the Louvre,<a id="FNanchor_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">982</a> form
our best examples of old Attic art outside
of the museums of Athens.<a id="FNanchor_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">983</a> The
swollen ears of the Jakobsen head show that it is from the funerary
statue of a victor, perhaps a boxer. Furtwaengler wrongly classed
it as a portrait head.<a id="FNanchor_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">984</a> A much discussed Attic work is the archaic relief
of a charioteer in the Akropolis Museum (Fig. <a href="#f63">63</a>).<a id="FNanchor_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">985</a> This was formerly
thought (<i>e. g.</i>, by Schrader) to be a block from the later Ionic frieze of
the old Hekatompedon which many believe survived the Persian sack,
but it is more likely a part of a frieze belonging to a small shrine or
altar. It represents a draped person entering a two-horse chariot
with the left foot, the hands outstretched to hold the reins, the head
and body leaning forward. Because of the <i>krobylos</i> treatment of the
hair, fitted for both sexes, and the long flowing robe, the sex has been
needlessly doubted, some calling it an Apollo or a mortal charioteer,
others an Athena or a Nike, even though the line of the breast, so far
as it is visible, shows no fullness, and the long chiton is common in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
representations of male charioteers.<a id="FNanchor_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">986</a> However, for the appreciation
of the relief it is of no consequence whether the figure is male or
female. It may be merely a dedicatory offering of a Panathenaic
victor in chariot racing, very possibly assimilated to the type of Apollo,<a id="FNanchor_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">987</a>
as the god often appears in vase-paintings of the same period in similar
costume mounting a chariot.<a id="FNanchor_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">988</a> We shall discuss its interpretation
more fully later on.<a id="FNanchor_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">989</a> While Ionism was prone to represent richly
draped figures which concealed the form of the body, we see in this
relief, with its fine modeling, a suggestion of the form beneath the
folds of the garment, and so, perhaps, only another example of an
Attic master rebelling against alien influence.<a id="FNanchor_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">990</a></p>

<p>At Olympia we have no names of Athenian sculptors prior to the
Persian war period. Kalamis helped Onatas with the monument of
King Hiero already mentioned. Mikon made a statue of a pancratiast,
Kallias of Athens, who won in Ol. 77 (&#8239;=&#8239;472 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">991</a> The great
Myron, of whom we shall speak at length in the next chapter,
made five statues of victors, which were erected between Ols.
77 and 84 (&#8239;=&#8239;472 and 444 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">992</a> Only four later Athenian artists
are mentioned: Silanion of the fourth century, who made statues for
three victors, whose victories ranged from Ols. 102 to 114 (&#8239;=&#8239;372 to
324 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>);<a id="FNanchor_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">993</a> Polykles the Elder, who made the statue of the boy pancratiast
Amyntas of Eresos, who won in Ol. (?) 146 (&#8239;=&#8239;196 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>);<a id="FNanchor_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">994</a>
Timarchides and Timokles, the sons of Polykles, who in common made
the statue of the boxer Agesarchos of Tritaia in Achaia, who won in
Ol. (?) 143 (&#8239;=&#8239;208 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>)<a id="FNanchor_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">995</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<h3>GENERAL MOTIVES OF STATUES AT REST.</h3>

<p>The victor represented as standing at rest was often characterized
by general motives, such as praying, anointing or scraping himself,
offering libations, and the like. We shall now consider such motives
in detail.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Adoration and Prayer.</span></h4>

<p>Prayer was a common motive represented in votive monuments.
Pliny mentions many such works by Greek sculptors.<a id="FNanchor_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">996</a> The custom
of raising the arms in prayer is found all through Greek literature,
from Homer down.<a id="FNanchor_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">997</a> Pausanias says that the people of Akragas made
an offering in the form of bronze statues of boys placed on the walls
of the Altis, προτείνοντάς τε τὰς δεξιὰς καὶ εἰκασμένους εὐχομένοις τῷ θεῷ,
these statues being the work of Kalamis.<a id="FNanchor_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">998</a> In the Athenian Asklepieion
there were many τύποι καταμακτοὶ πρὸς πινακίῳ, among which
were representations of men and women in the praying attitude.<a id="FNanchor_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">999</a>
The motive was used at Olympia in victor statues, representing the
victor as raising the hand in prayer to invoke victory.<a id="FNanchor_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">1000</a> The statue
of the wrestler Milo, already discussed at length, shows that this
motive was employed at Olympia in the improved “Apollo” type in
the second half of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">1001</a> From the next century
we may cite the statue of the Spartan chariot victor Anaxandros,
which was represented as “praying to the god,”<a id="FNanchor_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">1002</a> and the statues of
the Rhodian boxers Diagoras and Akousilaos, as we learn from a
scholion on Pindar,<a id="FNanchor_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">1003</a> which is based on a fragment of Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">1004</a>
and on one of Apollas.<a id="FNanchor_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">1005</a> Of the statue of Diagoras it says: τὴν
δεξιὰν ἀνατείνων χεῖρα, τὴν δὲ ἀριστερὰν εἰς ἑαυτὸν ἐπικλίνων; of
that of Akousilaos: τῇ μὲν ἀριστερᾷ ἱμάντα ἔχων πυκτινόν, τὴν δὲ δεξιὰν
ὡς πρὸς προσευχὴν ἀνατείνων.<a id="FNanchor_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">1006</a> The bronze statue from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Athens, now in the Antiquarium, Berlin,<a id="FNanchor_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">1007</a> which represents a
nude boy with the right hand raised as if in prayer and the left
lowered and holding a leaping-weight—therefore a pentathlete—seems
to correspond with this description of the statue of Akousilaos.
The same motive may have been used in the statue of the
chariot victress Kyniska, a princess of Sparta, whose statue along with
that of her charioteer and the chariot was the work of the sculptor
Apellas.<a id="FNanchor_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">1008</a> This is the interpretation of Furtwaengler,<a id="FNanchor_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">1009</a> based on a
passage in Pliny, which mentions statues of <i>adornantes se feminas</i><a id="FNanchor_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">1010</a> by
Apellas, which he reads <i>adorantes feminas</i>. However, <i>adornantes</i> may
be right, for in another passage, Pliny speaks of Praxiteles’ statue
of a ψελιουμένη, <i>i. e.</i>, of a woman clasping a bracelet on her arm.<a id="FNanchor_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">1011</a>
Two notable bronze statues will illustrate this motive of Olympic victor
statues. The statue found in 1502 at Zellfeld in Carinthia, now
in Vienna,<a id="FNanchor_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">1012</a> has been interpreted both as a Hermes Logios and a votive
statue in the attitude of prayer,<a id="FNanchor_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">1013</a> which latter interpretation the
inscription on the leg, giving a list of dedications,<a id="FNanchor_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">1014</a> favors. However,
Furtwaengler believes it a free imitation of an Argive victor statue,
though not in the Polykleitan style. Because of its similarity to the
<i>Idolino</i> (Pl. <a href="#p14">14</a>), he has ascribed its original to the sculptor Patrokles.
From technical considerations he believes it is not a Greek original
dedicated by Romans of a later period, but a Roman work (after
Patrokles) of the period of the inscription.<a id="FNanchor_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">1015</a> The bronze statue of the
<i>Praying Boy</i> in Berlin<a id="FNanchor_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">1016</a> (Pl. <a href="#p10">10</a>) is one of our most beautiful Greek
bronzes and comes from the circle of Lysippos.<a id="FNanchor_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">1017</a> We now know that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
the uplifted arms of this statue, in which most scholars saw the Greek
attitude of prayer, are restorations which were probably made in the
time of Louis XIV, when the statue was in France. Of the original
motive we only can say that the action of the shoulders shows that both
arms were raised, but we do not know how far, or the position of the
hands. Monumental evidence shows that the hands in prayer should
have the palms turned away from the face instead of upwards, as in
the present statue, since the Greek position was the outgrowth of an
old apotropaic gesture, <i>i. e.</i>, one directed against an evil spirit. Mau’s
idea<a id="FNanchor_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">1018</a> that the figure represented a player catching a ball is certainly
inconsistent with the calm attitude of the statue. Furtwaengler
rejected it,<a id="FNanchor_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">1019</a> and he has restored the arms and hands on the basis of a
Berlin gem<a id="FNanchor_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">1020</a> and an <i>ex voto</i> relief found by the French excavators at
Nemea in 1884.<a id="FNanchor_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">1021</a> On this relief a youth crowned with a woolen fillet
is represented. On both relief and gem the figures are in the same
attitude, the arms raised over the head <i>manibus supinis</i>, which confirms
the restoration of the Berlin statue. Many other monuments
give the more usual attitude of prayer, not as in the relief and gem discussed,
but with only one hand extended as high as the breast. Older
writers thought that such monuments did not represent the gesture of
adoration, but one of <i>adlocutio</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">1022</a> an opinion disproved by Pausanias’
statement about the bronze statues of the Akragantines at Olympia,
already mentioned. We may cite a relief from Kleitor, now in Berlin,<a id="FNanchor_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">1023</a>
and a fine one of the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> from Lamia (?),<a id="FNanchor_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">1024</a> as well as a
red-figured Etruscan stamnos in Vienna representing, probably, Ajax
praying before committing suicide.<a id="FNanchor_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">1025</a> We shall mention also two little
statuettes in New York which represent youths in the praying attitude.<a id="FNanchor_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">1026</a>
The first, dating from the second half of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
and showing Polykleitan influence, represents a nude youth standing
erect with the forearms bent, showing that the two hands were extended

<h4><span class="smcap">Anointing.</span></h4>

<p>Various familiar motives from the everyday life of the gymnasium
and palæstra were reproduced in the statues of athletes. One of
the commonest methods was to represent the victor anointing his body
with oil. The use of oil was indispensable in all athletic exercises,
in order to make the body and limbs more supple, and especially in
wrestling and the pankration, to make it difficult for one’s antagonist
to get a grip.<a id="FNanchor_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">1027</a> Pliny mentions a painting by Theoros, representing a
man <i>se inunguentem</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">1028</a> which appears to have been a votive portrait of
an athlete. The motive was common in vase-paintings and statuary.
Several red-figured vases of the severe style, antedating the statues to
be considered, show from realistic representations of palæstra scenes
that it was customary for athletes to hold a round aryballos high in the
right hand and pour oil from it into the left, which was placed across
the body horizontally.<a id="FNanchor_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">1029</a> The same motive appears with variations in
statues.<a id="FNanchor_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">1030</a> Thus the statue of an ephebe in Petworth House, Sussex,
England,<a id="FNanchor_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">1031</a> a statue, as Furtwaengler says, to be praised more for its
excellent preservation than for its workmanship, represents an athlete,
who holds a globular aryballos in his right hand raised over the shoulder,
while the left arm is held across the abdomen. On the nearby tree-trunk
are small cylindrical objects which seem to be boxing pads. This
statue, and especially its head, have been regarded by Michaelis and
Furtwaengler as unmistakably Polykleitan in style.<a id="FNanchor_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">1032</a> Several other
copies of original statues representing athletes pouring oil have been
wrongly classed as replicas of one original,<a id="FNanchor_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">1033</a> though they merely have
essential features alike, due chiefly to the subject. First is the
famous statue in the Glyptothek known as the <i>Oelgiesser</i> (<i>Oil-pourer</i>),
a Roman copy of an Attic bronze of about the middle of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> (Pl. <a href="#p11">11</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">1034</a>
Though the right arm and left hand are
lost, it is clear that the athlete held in his raised right hand an oil
flask, as in the Petworth statue.<a id="FNanchor_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">1035</a> Notwithstanding that the head
resembles the Praxitelian <i>Hermes</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">1036</a> this does not show that the statue
is of fourth-century origin, for its original is older; it merely shows that
the art of Praxiteles was deeply rooted in that of his fifth-century

predecessors. Because of its Attic
affiliations, Klein tried to identify
it with the Ἐγκρινόμενος of Alkamenes
mentioned by Pliny,<a id="FNanchor_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">1037</a> by amending
that title to Ἐγχριόμενος,
the “Anointer.” Brunn, however,
rightly saw the analogy of the body
forms to Myron’s <i>Marsyas</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">1038</a> and
Furtwaengler and Bulle have ascribed
it to Lykios, the son and
pupil of that master, who worked
about 440 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, the approximate
date of the original of the statue.
A fragmentary head in the Boston
Museum of Fine Arts (Fig. <a href="#f23">23</a>),<a id="FNanchor_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">1039</a>
formerly in private possession in
England, is a copy of the same
original as the Munich statue. Its
special interest is that it is not an
exact copy of the original, as the
Munich statue is, but a freer one,
showing a fuller mouth, fleshier cheeks, and deeper-set eyes. While
the Munich statue is the dry work of a Roman copyist of Augustus’
time, this head is by a far abler Greek copyist of the second century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> A torso in the Albertinum in Dresden, without a head,<a id="FNanchor_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">1040</a> is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
similar to the Munich statue, but hardly a replica. It probably
goes back to an original by an Attic master of the end of the fifth
or beginning of the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> Other under life-size statues
related to this torso show the same motive.<a id="FNanchor_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">1041</a> A black-marble
statue found at Porto d’Anzio in 1758, and now in the Glyptothek,<a id="FNanchor_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">1042</a>
has the Polykleitan standing motive. The left arm, which is stretched
out, holds an oil flask in the hand, while the right arm is lowered. The
band, which the position of the fingers shows that the right hand probably
held, indicates it is the statue of a victor. A bronze statuette
from South Italy, now in the British Museum,<a id="FNanchor_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">1043</a> represents a nude
youth holding an alabastron in his right hand, while the left has
the palm open to receive the oil. The hair fashion (κρωβύλος) seems
to point to an Attic sculptor of about 470 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">1044</a> The same motive

<h4><span class="smcap">Oil-scraping.</span></h4>

<p>Another ordinary palæstra motive was employed in representing
the athlete after the contest, scraping oil and dirt from his body
and arms with the scraping-blade or strigil (στλεγγίς, <i>strigilis</i>).<a id="FNanchor_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">1048</a>
This motive is not uncommon on r.-f. vase-paintings of the fifth cen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>tury
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">1049</a> It was treated in sculpture by many masters. Pliny
mentions such statues of athletes <i>destringentes se</i> (ἀποξυόμενοι), by
Polykleitos, Lysippos, and Daidalos of Sikyon.<a id="FNanchor_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">1050</a> Perhaps the <i>perixyomenoi</i>
by Antignotos and Daïppos, the latter the son of Lysippos, had
the same motive.<a id="FNanchor_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">1051</a> Of the <i>Apoxyomenos</i> of Polykleitos we have no
authenticated copies in sculpture, though Furtwaengler believes that
he has found reminiscences of it on gems which represent a youth
resting the weight of his body on the left leg, the right being drawn
back (<i>i. e.</i>, in the attitude of the <i>Doryphoros</i>), the right forearm
extended, and the left holding a strigil. The similarity of these
gem-designs makes it certain that they are all derived from a well-known
work of art.<a id="FNanchor_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">1052</a> Perhaps the fine bronze statuette, dating from
the middle of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, and now in the Loeb collection in
Munich, represents the pose of the <i>destringens se</i> by Polykleitos.<a id="FNanchor_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">1053</a> It
represents a nude youth resting the weight of the body on the soles
of both feet, the left one slightly advanced, and holding a strigil in
the raised right hand. The famous marble copy of an <i>Apoxyomenos</i> in
the Vatican<a id="FNanchor_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">1054</a> (Pl. <a href="#p29">29</a>), which, because of its long slim legs and graceful
ankles, might well represent a runner, has long been held to represent
the canon of Lysippos, as it exhibits proportions widely different
from those employed by Polykleitos, and agreeing with Pliny’s account
of Lysippos’ innovations.<a id="FNanchor_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">1055</a> However, the doubts arising in recent
years as to whether this statue is a copy of Lysippos’ statue or a later
work will be considered at length in Chapter VI.<a id="FNanchor_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">1056</a></p>

<div class="caption">Statue of an <i>Apoxyomenos</i>. Uffizi Gallery, Florence.</div>
</div>

<p>The same motive is exemplified by many existing statues, statuettes,
reliefs, etc. The marble statue of an athlete in the Uffizi, Florence,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
(Pl. <a href="#p12">12</a>),<a id="FNanchor_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">1057</a> a copy of an original of the end of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>,
wrongly restored as holding in both hands a vase at which the athlete
is looking down, was interpreted by Bloch as an ephebe pouring
oil from a lekythos held in the right hand into an aryballos held
in the left. This action for an athlete has been characterized by
Furtwaengler as “unparallelled, unclassical and, above all, absurd.”
Through recent discoveries we now know that it represents an apoxyomenos,
and that it should be restored with the left forearm close to
the thigh, and with the right crossing the abdomen diagonally in the
direction of the left hand. This attitude so closely corresponds with
that of a figure on a gem as to make it probable that both gem and
statue are copies of the same original. The figure on the gem<a id="FNanchor_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">1058</a> holds
a strigil in both hands and is generally explained as scraping the dirt
from the left thigh; the light hand holds the handle and the left the
blade. A hydria, palm-branch, and crown are pictured to the right—showing
that the figure represents an athlete, just as the statue has the
swollen ears of one. The attention of the athlete in both monuments
is concentrated on the operation involved—a concentration reminding
us of Myron’s <i>Diskobolos</i>. While, however, in the latter work the
concentration is momentary, it is less transient in the Florence statue
and also in the Munich <i>Oil-pourer</i>. This pose is too conscious in the
Florentine statue to be the work of Myron. Arndt names no artist,
but as the similarity between the head of the statue and that of the
<i>Oil-pourer</i> is so marked, and as every one now regards the latter as
Attic—even if not by Alkamenes—he thinks that the two must be
by the same Attic sculptor, although the Uffizi statue is somewhat
later than the Munich one.<a id="FNanchor_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">1059</a> The original of the Florence statue
was famous, if we may judge by the existing number of replicas with
variations.<a id="FNanchor_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">1060</a></p>

<p>Among statues showing the same motive and pose, we may note the
bronze statue of an athlete over life-size—pieced together from 234<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
fragments—found by the Austrians at Ephesos and now in Vienna.<a id="FNanchor_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">1061</a>
The subject, pose, and heavy proportions recall the Argive school of
Polykleitos, and its original has been assigned by Hauser to the Sikyonian
Daidalos, the son and pupil of Patrokles, who was the pupil of
Polykleitos. As further reproductions of the same type of figure, we
may cite a bronze statuette in Paris,<a id="FNanchor_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">1062</a> and a marble one found at
Frascati in 1896 and now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.<a id="FNanchor_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">1063</a></p>

<p>A chalcedony scarab of archaic type in the British Museum represents
a nude athlete with a lekythos slung over the left arm and a
strigil in the left hand, which rests on the hip.<a id="FNanchor_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">1064</a> A beautiful marble

with his arms extended to the right, cleansing himself with a strigil,
which is held in the right hand, while a slave boy, holding the remnant
of an aryballos in his right hand, looks up at him from the right. The
careful anatomy of this relief may point to Pythagoras of Samos, as
its author, though we have no certain work of his, for it fits the description
of that artist by Pliny, who says that he was the first to express
sinews and veins.<a id="FNanchor_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">1066</a></p>

<p>An original Greek bronze statuette in Paris (Fig. <a href="#f24">24</a>)<a id="FNanchor_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">1067</a> reproduces the
motive of the statue of the boy wrestler Xenokles by the sculptor

those of the <i>Doryphoros</i> and <i>Diadoumenos</i>, and as its execution is so
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
marvelous, Furtwaengler has ascribed the statuette to the circle of
Polykleitos’ pupils. The position of the right hand, which has the
thumbs drawn in, corresponds with that of the <i>Idolino</i> (Pl. <a href="#p14">14</a>), which
we are to discuss, and can best be explained by assuming that it
similarly held a kylix; the left hand carried a staff-like attribute.

Athlete. Louvre, Paris.</span></span>
The head is bent and looks to the right.
Furtwaengler believed that, inasmuch
as the act of pouring a libation does not
occur in art or literature as an athletic
motive, the statuette represented a hero
or god. Many Roman marble copies
show the same motive and preserve
to us a Polykleitan work which corresponds
in all essentials with the
Louvre statuette.<a id="FNanchor_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">1069</a> We mention two,
the only ones of the type in which the
heads are on the trunks, one in the
Galleria delle Statue of the Vatican,<a id="FNanchor_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">1070</a>
the other in the Farnsworth Museum
at Wellesley College (Pl. <a href="#p13">13</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">1071</a> These
copies represent a youth standing with
both feet flat upon the ground, the
weight of the body resting upon the
right one, while the left is turned a
little to the side. He is looking downwards
to the right. Doubtless we
should restore these copies after the
Paris bronze, with a kylix in the right
hand. The palm-branch in a similar
statue, to be mentioned further on,
shows that in all probability the origin
statue was that of an athlete; and
that he was a famous athlete is shown
by the number of copies of the torso and head.<a id="FNanchor_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">1072</a> A bronze head
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
from Herculaneum (Fig. <a href="#f25">25</a>)<a id="FNanchor_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">1073</a> so strongly resembles in its forms the
type under discussion—which Furtwaengler has called the “Vatican
athlete standing at rest”<a id="FNanchor_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">1074</a>—and corresponds with it so closely in
its measurements, that it might be regarded as a copy of the same
original, if certain differences, not due to the copyist, did not rather
show that it comes from a closely allied work. This head shows
an intense melancholy, which has been explained by Furtwaengler
as due to the lack of skill on the part of the copyist, who fashioned
it slightly askew. Amelung very properly explains the absence of
the motive of libation-pouring in athletic art as merely a lacuna in
our sources.<a id="FNanchor_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">1075</a> If the original of these copies and variations represented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
an athlete, he was certainly pouring a libation before victory; if a
warrior, he was doing the same thing before going on a campaign.
In the latter case the left hand should be restored with a spear.</p>

<p>We must also place here the life-size original Greek bronze in Florence,
discovered at Pesaro, near Ancona, in 1530, and known from the
early eighteenth century as the <i>Idolino</i> (Pl. <a href="#p14">14</a>),<a id="FNanchor_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">1076</a> for its motive connects
it with the series just discussed. This is, perhaps, our finest
bronze statue from antiquity, as it represents the highest ideal of boy
beauty, just as the <i>Doryphoros</i> does of manly beauty. The chief
characteristics—the positions of the feet, head, and arms, though essentially
those of the statues discussed, offer certain differences. Thus
the left leg is placed more to one side and turned further outwards
than in the statue of Xenokles and kindred works; the left hand hangs
down at an angle to the leg differently from the others. In other
words, by comparing it with the Paris statuette, we see a slightly different
rhythm from that found in Polykleitan works. The <i>Idolino</i> has
been looked upon as Myronic by Kekulé,<a id="FNanchor_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">1077</a> Studniczka,<a id="FNanchor_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">1078</a> and hesitatingly
Klein,<a id="FNanchor_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">1079</a> while Mahler regarded it as Pheidian.<a id="FNanchor_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">1080</a> Furtwaengler,
however, by a careful analysis, has shown its Polykleitan characteristics—especially
the shape of the head and the features, and the
treatment of the hair, which reminds us of the Naples copy of the
<i>Doryphoros</i>. Owing to differences, however, he did not assign it to
the master himself, but suggested that it was the work of his pupil
Patrokles.<a id="FNanchor_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">1081</a> Bulle found the head Polykleitan, but the body Attic,
and assigned the figure to an unknown Attic sculptor working in
the Polykleitan circle. In this controversy on its style, a statue
found in 1916 in the excavations of the Baths at Kyrene should be of
use, for it is the most faithful of all the Roman copies known of the
bronze original and clearly shows a Polykleitan character influenced by
Attic art.<a id="FNanchor_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">1082</a> By a comparison of this marble copy with the Florentine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
bronze we see that the latter was a subsequent rendition of the same
original, and doubtless by some artist of lesser fame from the Polykleitan
school, who was influenced by Attic art.</p>

<p>But it is the interpretation of the <i>Idolino</i> which chiefly interests us
here. While Longpérier called the similar Paris statuette a <i>Mercure
aptère</i>, and the publisher of the statue from Kyrene called that copy
a <i>Hermes</i>, yet Kekulé, Bulle, and most other archæologists have seen in
the <i>Idolino</i> an athlete. The inner surface of its outstretched right
hand is left rough, and the fingers are in the same position as those of
the Paris bronze. Such a position can be explained satisfactorily by
restoring the hand with a kylix or a φιάλη, such as was commonly used
in libations. The left hand is smooth and evidently empty, though
Bulle restores it with a victor’s fillet, and so, following Kekulé, calls
the statue that of a boy victor, who is bringing an offering to the altar
in honor of his victory. The marble statue in the Galleria delle Statue
has the right forearm restored; in the Kyrene statue the right hand is
preserved and has a thick object held downwards at a greater angle
than in the <i>Idolino</i>. The photograph does not let us judge decisively,
but it seems to be too thick an object for the remnants of a
kylix. A marble statue in the Barberini Palace, Rome,<a id="FNanchor_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">1083</a> which resembles
the <i>Idolino</i> so closely as to be considered a copy of it, though with
variations of pose and technique, has the arms broken off, and so adds
nothing to the solution of the motive of the <i>Idolino</i>. The fact that a
palm-stem stands beside the right leg, however, adds weight to the
interpretation as victor. Furtwaengler interprets the <i>Idolino</i> and kindred
works as divinities. Though boys serve at libations, he thinks
they never perform the ritual act of pouring the libation.<a id="FNanchor_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">1084</a> That a
libation-pourer should appear in the guise of a boy victor (that of
Xenokles) he calls a genuine Argive trait. Svoronos, also, has recently
tried to show that the <i>Idolino</i> is not a victor,<a id="FNanchor_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">1085</a> but represents the hero
Herakles. He compares the figure with a fourth-century Pentelic
marble relief in Athens,<a id="FNanchor_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">1086</a> which represents Herakles standing at the
door of Hades and beside him a father leading his son up to the open
air. The pose of the figure of Herakles resembles that of the <i>Idolino</i>
in a remarkable way. In the relief Herakles holds a kylix in the right
hand<a id="FNanchor_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">1087</a> and a club in the left, and a lion skin is thrown over the left arm.
Svoronos believes that the left hand in the relief explains the turning in

a club. We must, however, leave the final solution of the motive of the
<i>Idolino</i> and kindred works open, although inclining to the belief that
they represent a victor.</p>

of a bronze original of the middle of the
fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">1089</a> In this statue Mayer has
seen the motive, and probably the copy, of the
<i>Splanchnoptes</i> (Roaster of Entrails) by the
sculptor Styphax (or Styppax) of Cyprus,
which, according to Pliny,<a id="FNanchor_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">1090</a> represented Perikles’
slave “roasting entrails and blowing hard
on the fire, to kindle it, till his cheeks swell.”
He thinks that the position of the broken
arms and a comparison of the figure with similar
ones on vases make the identification possible.
Von Salis concurs in his restoration and
interpretation and publishes a small statuette
in Athens from Dodona,<a id="FNanchor_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">1091</a> which has a similar
pose, and holds a three-pronged fork in the
left hand, which he believes should be restored
in the statue. Although statue and statuette
have much in common (<i>e. g.</i>, the position of
the breast and shoulders, the treatment of the
hair, etc.), which shows that both may be copies
of one original, the conception of the two is
somewhat different. The statue from Athens
represents a boy standing busily engaged at
the altar; the statuette represents one standing
at rest merely looking on, the fork not
being held in position for use.<a id="FNanchor_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">1092</a> In any case
the face of the Athens statue can not correspond
with Pliny’s description—<i>ignemque oris<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
pleni spiritu accendens</i>. Quite a different explanation of the statue is
possible—one which Mayer thought improbable. The right arm—broken
above the wrist—was raised to the height of the shoulder
and may have held an object in the hand; the left arm—broken off
below the shoulder—seems to have been held close to the body and
appears to have corresponded in movement with the other. The boy,
therefore, may have held a cup in the right hand and a branch or a
victor fillet in the left. Thus it may merely be another example of
a boy victor pouring a libation.</p>

<p>Certain other statues have been mistaken either for libation-pourers
or oil-pourers, when they are really wine-pourers and have nothing to
do with the athletic motives under discussion. A good example is the
marble statue of a <i>Satyr</i> in Dresden,<a id="FNanchor_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">1093</a> which represents the youthful
demi-god lifting a can with his right hand, out of which he is pouring
wine into a drinking-horn held in the left. There are many copies of this
work,<a id="FNanchor_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">1094</a> a fact which shows that the original bronze was famous. An
attempt has therefore been made to identify it with the bronze <i>Satyr</i> of
Praxiteles mentioned by Pliny as the <i>Periboëtos</i> or “far-famed,”<a id="FNanchor_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">1095</a> which
seems to have been grouped with a <i>Dionysos</i> and a figure of <i>Drunkenness</i>—a
grouping which might fit the Dresden <i>Satyr</i>, since a second
figure should be imagined, for which the horn is being filled. However,
it differs stylistically so much from the <i>Hermes</i> of Olympia that the
ascription has been given up, though its graceful form shows Praxitelean
influence and certainly emanates from the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Resting After the Contest.</span></h4>

<p>A very favorite motive was to represent a victor, either standing or
seated, resting after the exertions of the contest (ἀναπαυόμενος). An
excellent example of this motive in a standing posture is the fourth-century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> statue of Attic workmanship found at Porto d’Anzio and
now in the Vatican,<a id="FNanchor_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">1096</a> which reproduces the type of the <i>Apollo Lykeios</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">1097</a>
Many of the statues, by various sculptors, which represent the victor
standing at rest may be intended to represent him as resting after the
contest. The well-known head of a youth adorned with the victor’s
chaplet, and preserved in four copies in European museums, appears
to come from a statue which represented a victor in this manner.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
The best of these copies is in the collection of Lord Leconfield at Petworth
House, Sussex.<a id="FNanchor_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">1098</a> We should add a fifth, a Roman copy of the
head, in the Metropolitan Museum, New York (Pl. <a href="#p15">15</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">1099</a> In these
copies the ears are not swollen, and a certain refinement and gentleness
show that the original was not from the statue of a boxer or pancratiast,
but from that of another type of athlete, perhaps a pentathlete.
Since Pliny mentions the statue of a <i>Doryphoros</i> by Kresilas,<a id="FNanchor_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">1100</a> and because
of its supposed Kresilæan style, Furtwaengler, albeit on slender
grounds, has attempted to identify the original of these heads with
that work.<a id="FNanchor_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">1101</a> The expression is certainly one of complete repose. On
the crown of the head, and on the left side over the fillet, is a rectangular
broken surface,<a id="FNanchor_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">1102</a> apparently the remnant of a support for the right arm,
which, as Conze thought, proves that the athlete stood with one arm
resting on the head, the hand hanging over the left side. Furtwaengler
admitted that such an attitude might be that of an apoxyomenos,<a id="FNanchor_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">1103</a>
but pointed out that the expression of the face in all the copies seems
too tranquil for such an interpretation. Since the victor was in repose
and the left arm required a slight support, he believed that this support
might have been an akontion. He therefore reconstructed the original
statue as that of a resting pentathlete, and assigned it to the great
Cretan contemporary of Pheidias, who worked in Athens.<a id="FNanchor_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">1104</a> The number
of replicas at least shows that the original was a famous work.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 27.—Head from Statue of the <i>Seated Boxer</i>.

</div>

<p>Perhaps our best example of the motive of a seated victor resting after
the contest is the bronze statue of a boxer found in Rome in 1884 and
now in the Museo delle Terme there (Pl. <a href="#p16">16</a> and Fig. <a href="#f27">27</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">1105</a> This is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
masterpiece in the portrayal of brute strength in the most naturalistic
and revolting way. If we like to think of victors as having noble forms,
we are rudely startled on looking at this brutal prize-fighter. If we
compare it with works of the fifth and fourth centuries <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, we see in
it, as in no other example of Greek sculpture, the great change which
professionalism had later wrought in the Greek ideal of athletics. Here
are massive proportions, bulging muscles, arms and legs hard and
muscle-bound. We can compare it only with the bronze head of a
boxer found at Olympia (Fig. <a href="#f61">61</a> A and B) of similar style and age.<a id="FNanchor_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">1106</a> But
there we have only the head, while here we have a complete statue
almost perfectly preserved, the only restorations being a portion of the
left thumb, a piece of the right flank, and the base.</p>

<div class="caption">Bronze Statue of the <i>Seated Boxer</i>. Museo delle Terme, Rome.</div>
</div>

<p>It represents a professional boxer, who is seated exhausted at the
close of the bout, the severity of which is indicated by every part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
body. He leans forward, his arms rest on his thighs, and his head,
sunk between his shoulders, is raised and turned to the right, as he
stupidly looks around at the applauding spectators. His nose is broken
and his ears are swollen and scars of the contest show on his face and
limbs. Beneath his retreating upper lip some of his teeth appear to
have been knocked out as the result of previous fights, while indications
of the recent struggle are to be seen in the blood dripping from his ears
and the deep lacerations in face and shoulder, which may have once
been filled with red paint to make his appearance even more realistic.
The right eye is swollen and the lower lid and the cheek imperceptibly
sink into each other. The mustache shows flecks of blood and the
swollen back of the right hand protrudes through the glove. His nose
is clotted with blood and he seems to be struggling to get his breath.</p>

<p>Such realism and delight in depicting the hideous show that the work,
like the Olympia head, belongs to the Hellenistic age. The careful workmanship,
especially visible in the hair and beard and in the hair on the
chest<a id="FNanchor_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">1107</a>, proves that the statue is not a Roman copy, but a Greek original
of the beginning of the Hellenistic age, of the end of the fourth or beginning
of the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> Nor is it a portrait, as Winter maintained,<a id="FNanchor_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">1108</a>
since it is an adaptation of a late type of Herakles. It certainly
is a victor statue from one of the great Greek games, and is, perhaps,
from Olympia itself. Since the head is turned toward the right shoulder
and the mouth is open, as if speaking, Wunderer tried, on the basis
of a passage in the history of Polybios,<a id="FNanchor_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">1109</a> to identify it with the statue
of the famous Theban boxer and pancratiast Kleitomachos at Olympia
by an unknown artist.<a id="FNanchor_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">1110</a> The historian states that Kleitomachos,
while fighting with the Egyptian Aristonikos, was angered by the
acclaim given the foreigner and, stepping aside, chided the spectators
for not cheering one who was fighting for the honor of Greece. The
speech caused a revulsion in the popular feeling, which helped, even
more than the fists of Kleitomachos, to vanquish Aristonikos. However,
the motive of the statue does not fit the incident, as the boxer
is not speaking, but breathing hard, nor is the seated posture that of
one haranguing a crowd. Moreover, the date of the Theban’s victory
is too late for the statue.<a id="FNanchor_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor">1111</a></p>

<h3>ATTRIBUTES OF VICTOR STATUES.</h3>

<p>At the beginning of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> athletic training tended
to produce a uniform standard of physical development, which was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
reflected in sculpture. At this date we do not find the divergence of
style which we saw in our review of the “Apollo” type of the sixth
century. Vase-paintings show the change better than sculpture. On
black-figured vases of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, we see a good deal of
variety in groups of boxers and wrestlers, while on red-figured vases of
the early fifth century the number of types is far less. In sculpture,
however, differences in physical type did exist in the various schools at
the beginning of the fifth century. We have, for example, the heavy,
square-shouldered type in the <i>Apollo Choiseul-Gouffier</i> (Pl. <a href="#p7A">7A</a>), which
we have classed as a victor statue, and the tall, rawboned type in the
<i>Tyrannicides</i> by Kritios and Nesiotes (Fig. <a href="#f32">32</a>, <i>Harmodios</i>).<a id="FNanchor_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">1112</a> We have,
on the other hand, a very different physical type in the short, stocky
Aeginetan pedimental figures (Figs. 20 and 21). Between such extremes
there are, of course, many gradations. We might instance
the archaic bronze statuette of a diskobolos in the Metropolitan Museum
(Fig. <a href="#f46">46</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">1113</a> However, notwithstanding the diversity in type,
it is often difficult to distinguish runners from wrestlers, boxers from
pentathletes. Thus few early fifth-century statues show the type of
runner as well as the <i>Apollo of Tenea</i> (Pl. <a href="#p8A">8A</a>), or that of a boxer
as well as the “<i>Apollo</i>” from Delphi (Pl. <a href="#p8B">8B</a>). The reason for this is
the ideal element, which entered into all these statues and which
was a reflection of the uniform development of athletics long before
specialization had set in. Out of this uniformity grew the canon of
Polykleitos, developed from that of Hagelaïdas.</p>

<p>The sculptor of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> was incapable of differentiating
between god and mortal. This was especially the case, as we have
seen, with Apollo, as the “Apollo” type was a model of manly vigor.
In the early fifth century the sculptor had largely overcome this difficulty,
but still showed little diversity of type in treating statues of
different kinds of athletes. A method of differentiation which was
essential to athlete sculptors of the sixth century was found convenient
of retention by those of the fifth—<i>i. e.</i>, characterizing the statue
of the victor by some attribute, in order, on the one hand, to differentiate
it from the nude god or hero, and on the other to distinguish
between different types of victors.</p>

<h3>PRIMARY ATTRIBUTES OF VICTOR STATUES.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Victor Fillet.</span></h4>

<p>In the first place, the sculptor would characterize the victor statue
as such. The easiest way to do this would be to represent it with a
fillet or chaplet (ταινία)<a id="FNanchor_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">1114</a> bound round the head, as we saw was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
case in the statue of Milo. This fillet was merely a band or riband of
wool which was given the Olympic victor in addition to the garland of
olive leaves, or the palm-branch, as a symbol of victory. Waldstein has
argued that this fillet originally was not an essential attribute of the
victor, but that the crown and palm were the prizes, and the fillet
merely a decoration used on various occasions, such as at symposia,<a id="FNanchor_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">1115</a>
which only later became a general athletic attribute.<a id="FNanchor_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">1116</a> Though the presence
of the fillet on statues should not, therefore, be proof that the
given statue is that of a victor,<a id="FNanchor_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">1117</a> there is no defense for the contention
of Passow<a id="FNanchor_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">1118</a> that the <i>tainia</i> was in no sense a symbol of victory, but
merely a toilet article among the gifts presented by the public to a
victor at the ovation of the crowning. Pausanias says that the victor
Lichas of Sparta was scourged by order of the umpires at Olympia
for having set the <i>tainia</i> on the head of his victorious charioteer.<a id="FNanchor_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">1119</a>
This is sufficient evidence that it was not a mere toilet article, but rather
a part of the official prize of victory. Similarly the <i>tainia</i> in the hand
of Nike upon the right hand of the statue of Zeus by Pheidias at
Olympia can not have been a toilet article.<a id="FNanchor_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">1120</a></p>

<p>We have many examples from athletic sculpture of the use of the
fillet. Thus it appears on the bronze head of a boxer in the Glyptothek
(Pl. <a href="#p3">3</a>)<a id="FNanchor_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">1121</a> and on the bronze head from Herculaneum in Naples
(Fig. <a href="#f4">4</a>),<a id="FNanchor_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">1122</a> both of which have been discussed in Chapter II, as fragments
of Greek original statues of Olympic victors. It also appears on
the marble head of a youthful victor—not necessarily Olympic—from
the Akropolis,<a id="FNanchor_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">1123</a> which, because of the similarity in cheeks, mouth, and
eyes to heads on the metopes of the Parthenon, should be dated somewhere
between 450 and 440 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> It occurs on the Olympia marble head<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
(Frontispiece and Fig. <a href="#f69">69</a>),<a id="FNanchor_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">1124</a> which we ascribe in Chapter VI to Lysippos,
and likewise on the statue of the pancratiast Agias in Delphi (Pl. <a href="#p28">28</a>,
Fig. <a href="#f68">68</a>). In most athlete heads the fillet is twisted into a knot at the
back of the head. In one case, on the Petworth head of a pentathlete
already discussed,<a id="FNanchor_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">1125</a> which, because of the curve of the neck, must come
from a statue represented at rest, it is not so tied, but is wound round
the head with the two ends tucked in and pushed through the fillet on
either side over the temples.<a id="FNanchor_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">1126</a> Though so practical an arrangement
as the latter must have been common enough in real life, this seems to
be the only example of its representation in sculpture.</p>

<p>The fillet, instead of encircling the head, was sometimes held in the
hand, as in the case of the Spartan chariot victor Polykles at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">1127</a>
A curious life-size statue of the Roman period, found in the Peiræus,
represents a nude boy holding in his right hand over the breast a bundle
of books and in the left an alabastron. The body is covered with
fillets—fifteen in all—which appear to have been prizes won in gymnic
contests, probably at the gymnasium or palæstra.<a id="FNanchor_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">1128</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Fillet-binders.</span></h4>

<p>Statues representing victors binding fillets in their hair (<i>diadoumenoi</i>)
are common to all periods of Greek art.<a id="FNanchor_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor">1129</a> We shall discuss
only two—those of Pheidias and of Polykleitos.</p>

<div class="caption">Statue known as the <i>Farnese Diadoumenos</i>. British Museum, London.</div>
</div>

<p>Pausanias mentions a statue by Pheidias, representing a <i>Boy Binding
on a Fillet</i>, as standing in the Altis at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">1130</a> Robert has
argued that this figure was the one of similar motive mentioned by
Pausanias as on the throne of Zeus there.<a id="FNanchor_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">1131</a> However, the figure on
the throne was very probably in relief and not in the round.<a id="FNanchor_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">1132</a> The cicerones
at Olympia seem to have been imposing on the periegete when
they said that a likeness to Pantarkes, the boy favorite of Pheidias, was
to be seen in the face of this figure on the throne. The mention of
Pantarkes has given rise to the usual identification of the παῖς ἀναδούμενος
with the victor statue of the Elean Pantarkes mentioned by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>Pausanias as standing in the Altis.<a id="FNanchor_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">1133</a> However, the assumption<a id="FNanchor_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">1134</a> is
far-fetched and must be rejected, because Pausanias mentions the two
statues in two different parts of his <i>periegesis</i> of the Altis.<a id="FNanchor_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">1135</a> Of the
παῖς we know only the artist’s name. It was probably merely a votive
gift,<a id="FNanchor_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">1136</a> and the name of the person so honored was unknown to Pausanias.
Of the statue of the victor Pantarkes we know only the name,
and neither the artist nor the motive of the statue. It seems clear,
therefore, that we have to do with three distinct monuments: the boy
with the fillet, the throne figure by Pheidias, and the victor by an
unknown sculptor.<a id="FNanchor_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">1137</a></p>

<p>The small marble statue in the British Museum known as the <i>Diadoumenos
Farnese</i><a id="FNanchor_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">1138</a> (Pl. <a href="#p17">17</a>), which is now almost universally regarded
as an Attic work,<a id="FNanchor_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor">1139</a> has been assumed by many archæologists to be a
copy of Pheidias’ statue.<a id="FNanchor_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">1140</a> Since Pausanias tells us that a statue by
Pheidias stood in Olympia, representing an unknown boy binding a
fillet around his head, and since the style of the <i>Farnese</i> statue shows
great similarity in head and body forms and general bearing to certain
figures on the Parthenon frieze,<a id="FNanchor_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor">1141</a> and its motive agrees with that of the
Olympia statue, it seems reasonable to see in this little work a copy of
the statue in the Altis by the great master. Furtwaengler and Bulle
have shown that the motive of this work was initiated by Pheidias and
not by Polykleitos, since the latter’s great statue was several years
younger than the work of Pheidias at Olympia. That Pheidias was
pleased with the motive is disclosed by the fact that he repeated it on
the throne of Zeus.</p>

<p>The <i>Diadoumenos</i> of Polykleitos was little less famous than his <i>Doryphoros</i>,
if we may judge by the number of copies which have survived
and from literary notices of it.<a id="FNanchor_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">1142</a> In all the copies of this work we see
the well-known Polykleitan characteristics—powerful build, heavy proportions,
and fidelity to nature; but none of the ideal tendency prominent
in the works of Pheidias and his school, nor of the violent energy
characteristic of Myron’s art. In all of them the pose of the earlier
<i>Doryphoros</i> is retained, except that the arms are differently employed
and the build of the body is more slender. Pliny, despite his statement—which
is probably taken from some Greek authority—that
monotony was the characteristic of Polykleitos’ works (<i>paene ad unum
exemplum</i>),<a id="FNanchor_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">1143</a> emphasizes this slenderness by calling the <i>Doryphoros</i>
<i>viriliter puer</i>—Lessing’s <i>Juengling wie ein Mann</i>—and the <i>Diadoumenos</i>
<i>molliter juvenis</i>—a youth of gentle form. This judgment of
Pliny was difficult to understand so long as we had only the Vaison
copy of the <i>Diadoumenos</i> to study. The Delian copy showed that
supple grace was characteristic of the original, even if modified to suit
the taste of three centuries later. Although the body forms and the
attitudes of the <i>Doryphoros</i> and the <i>Diadoumenos</i> are very similar,
the head of the latter, usually assigned to Polykleitos, is of a different
type from that of the <i>Doryphoros</i>. While the head of the <i>Doryphoros</i> is
square in profile, flat on top, and long from front to back, that of the
<i>Diadoumenos</i> is rounder and softer and can best be explained on the
assumption that Polykleitos later in life came under Attic influence.
The copies of this work are many and varied.<a id="FNanchor_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">1144</a> For a long time the
marble copy in the British Museum found in 1862, at Vaison, France,<a id="FNanchor_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">1145</a>
was, despite its poor workmanship, considered our best copy (Fig. <a href="#f28">28</a>).
It was made perhaps five hundred years after the original, at a time
when sculpture was in its decline, and consequently can give us merely
a suggestion of the character of Polykleitos’ statue. As it is a direct
marble translation of the bronze, the muscular treatment appears exaggerated.
Another marble copy was found in 1894 by the French
excavators on the island of Delos, and is now in Athens (Pl. <a href="#p18">18</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">1146</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>

hands are lost, it is easy to see that the athlete is pulling the ends of the

is a Hellenistic Greek copy, it comes far nearer to the original than the

imperial Roman one from Vaison.
The lighter proportions and softer
modeling show the Attic influence
on Polykleitos’ later career,
although the fleshy forms are out
of harmony with his art and evidently
introduced by the copyist.
One of the best preserved and
most beautiful copies is the one in
the Prado at Madrid.<a id="FNanchor_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">1148</a> Although a
Roman copy, like the one in the
British Museum, it comes very near
the original because of the precision
in its details. There are many
good copies of the head alone.<a id="FNanchor_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">1149</a>
Marble heads in Kassel and Dresden,
evidently the works of Attic
sculptors, show the pure Polykleitan
traits. The one in Dresden<a id="FNanchor_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">1150</a>
(Fig. <a href="#f29">29</a>) surpasses all others in the
beauty of its finish, being a careful
and exact copy. The proportions
and structure of the head are
those of the <i>Doryphoros</i>, although
the surface is differently treated.
The Kassel head<a id="FNanchor_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">1151</a> is not so exact in
its details, but has more expression.
Furtwaengler rightly calls
it the better of the two as a work of art, but inferior as a copy. A
marble head in the British Museum<a id="FNanchor_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor">1152</a> is a direct copy from the original<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
bronze, like the Vaison statue. The clear-cut eyelids and wiry hair
reproduce the original material, and its resemblance to the head of
the <i>Doryphoros</i> is greater than that of any other copy.</p>

<p>A later variant of the statue is seen in a small terra-cotta statuette from
Smyrna in private possession in London.<a id="FNanchor_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor">1153</a>
<span class="figright250"><a id="f29"></a>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.</span>—Head of the <i>Diadoumenos</i>,

It shows the Polykleitan type
so completely assimilated to the style
of Praxiteles that its genuineness
has been doubted. Perhaps, with
its Attic softness, it gives us a better
idea of the beauty of the original
than many of the other copies.
Finally, we must mention the
original bronze head of the fifth century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> in the Ashmolean Museum,
Oxford, recently published by Percy
Gardner.<a id="FNanchor_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154" class="fnanchor">1154</a> This head, put together
from nine fragments, and restored as
that of a boy fillet-binder, and rivaling
in delicacy and beauty such
original bronzes as the Beneventum
head (Fig. <a href="#f3">3</a>) and the <i>Idolino</i> (Pl.
<a href="#p14">14</a>), not only gives us the best idea
of the technical ability attained by
bronze workers in the middle of the
fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, but also helps us to
understand the ancient repute of Polykleitos’ athletes. Here the headband
and “starfish” arrangement of the hair have their close parallels
in the Dresden, Kassel, and British Museum heads already discussed,
which essentially reproduce the head of the Vaison statue (Fig. <a href="#f28">28</a>).
As Gardner points out, it closely agrees with the type of the
<i>Farnese Diadoumenos</i> (Pl. <a href="#p17">17</a>) only in one particular, the mode of tying
the knot. While the Vaison athlete is preparing to tie it, the Farnese
one has just finished the operation, the boy still holding the ends of the
fillet in his hands. But only the treatment of the hair, the eye, and the
ear offers a contrast. Despite these differences Gardner follows the older
view of Brunn in regarding the Vaison and Farnese types as two variants
of Polykleitan originals; but the pose, style, and proportions of the
latter seem to us to be too thoroughly Attic to warrant us in bringing
it into relation with the work of Polykleitos. Though the heads of the
two are not so dissimilar, the pose, as Gardner also points out, is
quite different. The Vaison figure is represented as walking, <i>i. e.</i>,
in the very act of changing the weight of the body from one leg to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
other, while the Farnese athlete stands at rest with both feet flat upon
the ground. Gardner rightly regards this exquisite head not as the
original of the statue mentioned by Pliny, since the Vaison and Delian
copies show that the latter represented a fully developed man, somewhat
over life-size, and not a boy, but rather as a work of the Polykleitan
school, though he does not exclude the possibility that it may
come from one of the many boy athletes of the master.</p>

<p>Furtwaengler connects with the <i>Diadoumenos</i> the statue of a youthful
boxer, slightly under life-size, which shows a similar motive. It
is known to us in two copies, one in Kassel,<a id="FNanchor_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">1155</a> the other in Lansdowne
House, London.<a id="FNanchor_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">1156</a> That it is a work of Polykleitos is shown by the
correspondence of its body forms with those of both the <i>Diadoumenos</i>
and the <i>Doryphoros</i>. A bronze statuette, dating from about 400 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>,
in the Akropolis Museum, also repeats the motive without being an
exact copy.<a id="FNanchor_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor">1157</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Crown of Wild Olive.</span></h4>

<p>The crown of wild olive<a id="FNanchor_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor">1158</a> in the hair is another general but not customary
attribute of Olympic victor statues. Fewer sculptured heads
show it than show the <i>tainia</i>, and in most of these the leaves have fallen
off. Examples of its presence are afforded by the bronze head from
Beneventum (Fig. <a href="#f3">3</a>) in the Louvre,<a id="FNanchor_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor">1159</a> and on the realistic bronze head
of a boxer found at Olympia (Fig. <a href="#f61">61</a> A and B).<a id="FNanchor_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">1160</a> A good illustration

artist of the Polykleitan school, the restoration of which as a victor
engaged in wreathing his head is probable.<a id="FNanchor_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">1162</a> A protuberance on the right

<p>The statue of a <i>Boy Crowning Himself</i>, which has survived in
many Roman copies and variant Greek originals, notably in the
so-called <i>Westmacott Athlete</i> of the British Museum (Pl. <a href="#p19">19</a>),<a id="FNanchor_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">1166</a> a fragmentary
statue of poorer workmanship in the Barracco collection
in Rome,<a id="FNanchor_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">1167</a> and a Greek copy from Eleusis now in the National
Museum in Athens,<a id="FNanchor_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">1168</a> and identified by many archæologists with the
statue of the boy boxer Kyniskos by Polykleitos at Olympia, should be
discussed here. While the <i>Westmacott Athlete</i> appears to be a copy
from the original bronze, the Barracco statue, though showing the
same pose, is unlike it in the treatment of hair and muscles, and with
its Attic head, seems to be a carelessly executed variant, more or less
Myronian in style, of the Polykleitan original. While its original may
be assigned to the end of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, the Eleusis variant,
with its head differently placed, is not a Roman copy, but a Greek original
statue showing the Polykleitan motive carried into the soft Attic
style of the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">1169</a> A fine copy of the head alone is in
the possession of Sir Edgar Vincent, in his Constantinople collection.<a id="FNanchor_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">1170</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
This should be associated with another head in Dresden, both being
closely related to that of the <i>Westmacott Athlete</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">1171</a> The best copy of the
head is in the Hermitage, in which the treatment of the hair approaches
nearest to that of the bronze original.<a id="FNanchor_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">1172</a> A marble head from Apollonia
in Epeiros, now in the British Museum, which so closely resembles the
head of the <i>Westmacott Athlete</i> that the missing sections of the neck and
shoulders were restored by a cast from the latter, is somewhat different
in style. For while the Westmacott head is a mechanical copy, this
Greek head is full of vigor, disclosing Attic characteristics of the early
fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, and obviously is an Athenian imitation of the
original, like the statue from Eleusis.<a id="FNanchor_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">1173</a> A more remote variant is the
beautiful marble head formerly in the possession of Dr. Philip Nelson in
Liverpool, but now in America, which is not an exact copy of any
of the known variants, but so closely resembles the Capitoline type
of <i>Wounded Amazon</i>, assigned first by Otto Jahn and later by Furtwaengler
to Kresilas, that it must be by the same hand.<a id="FNanchor_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">1174</a> This head
also reminds us of that of the Kresilæan <i>Diomedes</i> of the Munich Glyptothek
(Pl. <a href="#p21">21</a>),<a id="FNanchor_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">1175</a> though the hair-treatment is Polykleitan.<a id="FNanchor_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">1176</a> Both show
a modification of Polykleitan forms under Attic influence. The numerous
fine copies indicate that the original was a well-known work. That
it was Polykleitan is clear from a study of the heads, which show a great
resemblance to that of the <i>Doryphoros</i>, and of the body forms, which
resemble those of both the <i>Doryphoros</i> and the <i>Diadoumenos</i>. While
some believe this original a work of Polykleitos himself,<a id="FNanchor_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">1177</a> others think
that it was by one of his pupils or successors, who imitated the
master’s early style. If the original, however, was not the statue of
Kyniskos, there is little evidence that it was by Polykleitos himself.</p>

<p>The palm-trunk in the Westmacott copy certainly argues that the
original was an athlete statue. The gesture of the right hand has given
rise to different interpretations. The Barracco copy furnishes the
best evidence, as on it the right arm is preserved to the wrist, the hand
only being lost. Helbig at first (in the Barracco Catalogue) expressed
the opinion that the right hand might have held an oil-flask, from which
oil was being poured into the left. However, the position of the left
hand, as shown by the <i>puntello</i> on the left hip, must have been the same
as that on the Westmacott copy, <i>i. e.</i>, hanging close to the left side.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
Helbig later (in the <i>Fuehrer</i>) explained the motive as that of a boy setting
a crown on his head, as in the bronze <i>Eros</i> already mentioned. This
interpretation, first suggested by Winnefeld,<a id="FNanchor_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">1178</a> has been the favorite one
among archæologists. But all sorts of other explanations of the motive
of the original have been offered, as that the athlete was scraping
his forehead or shoulders with the strigil,<a id="FNanchor_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">1179</a> that the statue represented
Narkissos looking into the pool and shading his eyes with his right
hand,<a id="FNanchor_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">1180</a> that it was an athlete standing at rest and holding an akontion
in his right hand—a theory harmonizing with the poise of the head,
but not with the turn of the wrist, which shows that the hand was
held downwards<a id="FNanchor_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">1181</a>—and that it was, in fact, the <i>nudus talo incessens</i> of
Pliny.<a id="FNanchor_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">1182</a> On the head of the Eleusis statue there is a mass of marble
left over the right ear just opposite the place where the hand would be,
if it were setting a wreath on the head. The fact that no marks are
visible where the crown was attached is explained by the assumption
that the wreath was of metal even in the marble copies. That this
motive, moreover, was known to both Attic and Peloponnesian art
in the second half of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> is well attested. Thus we
see on the Parthenon frieze a youth crowning himself with one hand,
while holding the horse’s bridle with the other.<a id="FNanchor_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">1183</a> The pose of this
figure—especially the legs—recalls the Myronian <i>Oil-pourer</i> already
discussed (Pl. <a href="#p11">11</a>). On the other hand, one of the figures of the Ildefonso
group in Madrid, which is Polykleitan in style, represents a boy
wearing a wreath, a figure closely akin to the <i>Westmacott Athlete</i>, the
leg position being the same in both and the poise of the head nearly so,
although the arms are different, the left one being raised and the right
hanging down.<a id="FNanchor_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor">1184</a> It is probable that the raised right hand of the original
of the Westmacott and other replicas touched the wreath and
the lowered left held a fillet. The best explanation, then, of the <i>Westmacott
Athlete</i> and kindred works is that the motive of the original
was allied to that of the <i>Diadoumenos</i> of Polykleitos, though the modeling
is too soft for Polykleitos, showing that the copyists changed the
original of the Argive master to suit a later and different taste. Whereas
the <i>Diadoumenos</i> is tying on a victor’s fillet, the other is presumably
placing a victor’s wreath on his head. Certainly no better restoration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
can be made for the Barracco copy. Furthermore, many other monuments,
which show a similar attitude, and which must be regarded as
very free imitations of the original, seem to show that the boy was
represented as placing a wreath on his head.<a id="FNanchor_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor">1185</a></p>

<p>Whether the original of the series was an actual victor statue at
Olympia or not is an interesting question. It has been repeatedly
suggested that it was the very statue of the boy boxer Kyniskos there,
mentioned by Pausanias, the base of which has been recovered.<a id="FNanchor_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor">1186</a> The
external evidence for the identity consists altogether in the similarity
in the position of the feet on this base and in the series of copies, which
argues a similar pose. The base shows that the left leg bore the weight
of the statue; it was slightly advanced and rested on the sole, while the
right leg was set back and rested on the ball only. Thus the statue of
Kyniskos was represented in the characteristic Polykleitan schema
of rest, except that the position of the legs is reversed from that of the
<i>Doryphoros</i>, <i>Diadoumenos</i>, <i>Amazon</i>, and other works of the master.
We might add that this same reversal appears on two other bases
found at Olympia, which held victor statues by the elder Polykleitos<a id="FNanchor_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor">1187</a>
and one by the younger.<a id="FNanchor_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor">1188</a> Moreover, the leg position of the canon
does not occur in the works of the master’s pupils Naukydes and Daidalos,
and only in one work of Kleon.<a id="FNanchor_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor">1189</a> This shows that teacher and
pupils also used another motive, <i>i. e.</i>, the old canon of Hagelaïdas,
besides the one associated with the <i>Doryphoros</i>. The similarity in the
position of the feet on the Olympia base and in the series of statues
discussed has led some scholars, <i>e. g.</i>, Petersen and Collignon, to accept
the proposed identity. This similarity in foot position, the probability
that the statue on the basis was life-size, like those of the Westmacott
series, and the palm-tree support in the British Museum replica, all
pointing to a victor statue, make the identity well within the range of
possibility, but by no means certain. It is necessary only to rehearse
the objections to this view. In the first place the length of the foot
on the Olympia basis can not be accurately measured for purposes of
comparison. In the next place Polykleitos, as we have just seen,
made other statues of victors at Olympia with almost the identical
foot position of that of Kyniskos. Furthermore, it seems very unlikely
that so celebrated an original as that of these many replicas could have
been standing in the Altis so late as the time of Pausanias.<a id="FNanchor_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor">1190</a> It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
difficult, also, to understand why an imitative Attic sculptor of the
fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, should make a copy of an Arkadian boy victor
statue for Eleusis. And lastly we must not forget that up to the
present time not a single Roman copy has been conclusively identified
with that of a victor statue at Olympia. If the date of the victory of
Kyniskos were definitely fixed, the question of identity would be better
substantiated. By a process of exclusion, to be sure, Robert reached
the date Ol. 80 (&#8239;=&#8239;460 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>),<a id="FNanchor_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">1191</a> but other dates are possible. Under
these circumstances there seems to be little more than the possibility
that we have recovered an actual victor statue at Olympia in these
copies.<a id="FNanchor_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">1192</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Palm-branch.</span></h4>

<p>The palm-branch, either woven into a wreath or held in the hand, was
a victor attribute. Pausanias says that a crown of palm leaves was
common to many contests, and that the victor everywhere in Greece
carried a palm-branch in his right hand.<a id="FNanchor_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">1193</a> He refers the custom to
mythical times, tracing it back to the contest held by Theseus on Delos
in honor of Apollo.<a id="FNanchor_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">1194</a> Pliny mentions a painting by the Sikyonian Eupompos,
which represented a <i>victor certamine gymnico palmam tenens</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor">1195</a>
While Milchhoefer<a id="FNanchor_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor">1196</a> believed that the motive of an athlete setting a
crown on his head with his right hand and holding a palm in his left,
which is repeated frequently and with variation in many works of
art, went back to this painting of Eupompos, Furtwaengler<a id="FNanchor_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor">1197</a> goes further
in assuming that the painter derived the motive from the statue
of Polykleitos represented by the <i>Westmacott Athlete</i> and kindred
works just discussed. The pupils of the great sculptor appear to have
transferred his school from Argos to Sikyon, and were, therefore, associated
with Eupompos. This attribute of the palm, permanent in
bronze statues, has been broken off for the most part in marble ones.
We see it in an unfinished statue of a young athlete in the National
Museum, Athens, who holds the palm-branch in his hand. Here it
has survived, since the statue was only blocked out.<a id="FNanchor_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor">1198</a> It is prominent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
in the funerary stele from the Dipylon representing a victor, which
has been mentioned in a preceding section;<a id="FNanchor_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor">1199</a> here the palm extends
from the left hand, which is held down close to the side, up to the shoulder.
We have already noted that the copyist added a palm-branch
to the stump placed beside the Vatican girl runner (Pl. <a href="#p2">2</a>). In the
<i>Choiseul-Gouffier Apollo</i> (Pl. <a href="#p7A">7A</a>) the left hand should doubtless be
restored with the palm-branch, because of the projecting notch of
marble on the side of the left leg near the knee.<a id="FNanchor_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor">1200</a> A similar notch
appears also on the <i>Apollo-on-the-Omphalos</i> in Athens (Pl. <a href="#p7B">7B</a>), which
shows that the left hand held a long attribute, which was doubtless a
palm-branch. This attribute occurs frequently on vases.<a id="FNanchor_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor">1201</a> We see
it on a marble statue found at Formiae and now in the Glyptothek
Ny-Carlsberg in Copenhagen, which shows the same motive as that
of the statue by Stephanos (Pl. <a href="#p9">9</a>), though in a freer style of execution.
Here the lowered right hand holds a palm-branch, which is shown in
low relief against the right arm.<a id="FNanchor_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor">1202</a></p>

<h3>SECONDARY ATTRIBUTES OF VICTOR STATUES.</h3>

<p>In course of time the sculptor was not content to represent victor
statues merely as victors, but differentiated the various kinds of
victors by special attributes.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Hoplitodromoi.</span></h3>

<p>Thus a hoplite victor would be represented with his usual weapons.
Pausanias, in mentioning the statue at Olympia of the hoplite runner
Damaretos of Heraia by the Argive sculptors Eutelidas and Chrysothemis,
says that it “has not only a shield, as the armed runners still
have, but also a helmet on his head and greaves on his legs.”<a id="FNanchor_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor">1203</a> He adds
that the helmet and greaves were gradually abolished at Olympia and
elsewhere. We have seen that the statue of Damaretos was set up at
the beginning of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, when his son Theopompos, the
pentathlete, won his second victory, the monuments of the two being
in common.<a id="FNanchor_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor">1204</a> Toward the middle of the fifth century the hoplite victor
Mnaseas of Kyrene had a statue at Olympia, the work of Pythagoras
of Rhegion, which represented him as an armed man.<a id="FNanchor_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor">1205</a> A Pythian
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
victor, Telesikrates, of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, had a statue at Delphi, which
represented him with a helmet.<a id="FNanchor_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor">1206</a> We have actual remnants of two
hoplite victor statues of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, in the two bearded and
helmeted life-size heads of Parian marble found at Olympia (Fig. <a href="#f30">30</a>,
a, b = A; c, d = B).<a id="FNanchor_1207"></a><a href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor">1207</a> The younger of these heads (A), to which
probably belong either an arm and the remnants of a shield attached
with a ram and a representation of Phrixos upon it in relief,<a id="FNanchor_1208"></a><a href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor">1208</a> or a shield
fragment with a siren’s wing upon it<a id="FNanchor_1209"></a><a href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor">1209</a> and the fragment of a shield<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
edge<a id="FNanchor_1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor">1210</a> and right foot of fine workmanship,<a id="FNanchor_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor">1211</a> I assigned long ago to the
statue of the Thessalian hoplitodrome Phrikias of Pelinna, who won
two victories in Ols. 68 and 69 (&#8239;=&#8239;508 and 504 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor">1212</a> R. Foerster had referred
this head to the statue of the hoplite runner Damaretos of Heraia,
whose monument, in common with that of his son, the pentathlete
Theopompos, was the work of the early Argive sculptors Chrysothemis
and Eutelidas.<a id="FNanchor_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor">1213</a> But this fresh and vigorous head is not Peloponnesian,
but shows strongly marked Attic traits in its round face, full
cheeks, and soft lips, and in the rows of regularly wound locks of hair.
The arm and foot similarly disclose Attic softness and grace. Because
of its Attic character, Treu and Overbeck,<a id="FNanchor_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor">1214</a> in opposition to Foerster,
ascribed it to the statue of the Elean hoplite victor Eperastos mentioned
by Pausanias.<a id="FNanchor_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor">1215</a> Though the date of his victory is unknown, it certainly
fell some time after Ol. 111 (&#8239;=&#8239;336 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>)—a date far too late for so
archaic a sculpture. Furtwaengler<a id="FNanchor_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor">1216</a> referred this and the more archaic
head B to the group of Phormis at Olympia, mentioned by Pausanias.<a id="FNanchor_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor">1217</a>
However, Treu<a id="FNanchor_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor">1218</a> showed that there was no stylistic connection between
the two heads. The slightly more archaic head B, badly injured
from weathering, I have referred to the Achaian hoplitodrome
Phanas of Pellene, who won Ol. 67 (&#8239;=&#8239;512 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor">1219</a> In this carefully
executed head the hair and beard are arranged in small locks and the
archaic smile is prominent. While the younger head is Attic, this
one is unmistakably Peloponnesian; and while the former comes from
a statue represented at rest, the latter, because of the twist of the neck,
seems to have come from one represented in violent motion. For this
reason Wolters believed that it came from the statue of a warrior represented
as thrown to the ground and defending himself.</p>

<p>The Myronic statue in the Palazzo Valentini, Rome, known as
<i>Diomedes</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor">1220</a> whose pose recalls the <i>Diskobolos</i>, may represent a hoplito<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>drome,
because of its marked resemblance in attitude to the Tuebingen
bronze to be discussed in the next chapter (Fig. <a href="#f42">42</a>), and because of
the helmet on its head.<a id="FNanchor_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor">1221</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Pentathletes.</span></h4>

<p>Pentathletes were represented by attributes taken from three of the
five contests—jumping, and throwing the diskos and the javelin. All
these attributes appear in gymnasium scenes pictured on red-figured
vases. Thus a kylix of the severe style in Munich<a id="FNanchor_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor">1222</a> gives us a general
picture of the exercises of the gymnasium. On the walls hang diskoi in
slings, strigils, leaping-weights, oil-flasks, sponges, and javelins. Archaic
leaping-weights (ἁλτῆρες) appeared in the hands of the statue of the
Elean Hysmon at Olympia by the Sikyonian sculptor Kleon.<a id="FNanchor_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor">1223</a> Similarly,
a figure of <i>Contest</i> (Ἀγών) in the group set up there by Mikythos
had weights.<a id="FNanchor_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor">1224</a> The offering of the people of Mende at Olympia very
nearly deceived Pausanias into thinking it the statue of a pentathlete,
because of its ancient <i>halteres</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor">1225</a> This shows that these weights
formed a regular attribute of pentathlete statues there. A relief from
Sparta<a id="FNanchor_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226" class="fnanchor">1226</a> represents an athlete leaning on his spear and holding a pair
of leaping-weights in his right hand. There is a bronze statue of such
a victor in the Berlin Antiquarium.<a id="FNanchor_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor">1227</a> <i>Halteres</i> hang on a tree-trunk
to the right of the statue of an athlete in the Pitti palace in Florence.<a id="FNanchor_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor">1228</a>
The breast of a marble torso, less than life-size, of a boy statue found
at Olympia, shows that the hands were stretched forward, and very
possibly the objects which they held were leaping-weights.<a id="FNanchor_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor">1229</a></p>

<p>We have no direct literary reference to a victor statue at Olympia of a
pentathlete with the attributes of the diskos or javelin. That they
existed there, however, seems probable enough. Such a work as the
<i>Diskobolos</i> of Myron, which displays the youthful victor in its every
line, other statues, statuettes, reliefs, and vase-paintings, show us how
the artist represented the different steps in the casting of the quoit.
Similarly, the famous <i>Doryphoros</i> of Polykleitos, copies of which
have been identified in many museums (Pl. <a href="#p4">4</a> and Fig. <a href="#f48">48</a>), will give
us an idea how a javelin thrower might have been represented at rest.
The akontion or victor’s casting-spear, was, as we see from the Spartan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
relief of a pentathlete just mentioned, about the height of a man. The
attitude of the diskobolos and doryphoros will be discussed at length
in the next chapter.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Boxers.</span></h4>

<p>The statue of a boxer would be sufficiently characterized by thongs,
which he might carry in his hand, as in the statue of the Rhodian
Akousilaos at Olympia,<a id="FNanchor_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor">1230</a> or wound round his forearm, as in the statue of
a boxer in the Palazzo Albani, Rome,<a id="FNanchor_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1231" class="fnanchor">1231</a> or on a near-by prop, as on the
tree-stump beside the <i>Choiseul-Gouffier Apollo</i> in the British Museum
(Pl. <a href="#p7A">7A</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor">1232</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Wrestlers.</span></h4>

<p>Long ago Scherer tried to show that the aryballos was a wrestler-attribute,
since oil was so important in wrestling.<a id="FNanchor_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233" class="fnanchor">1233</a> He interpreted as
<i>aryballoi</i> the pomegranates mentioned by Pausanias as held in the
hands of the statues of the wrestlers Milo<a id="FNanchor_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor">1234</a> and Theognetos<a id="FNanchor_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235" class="fnanchor">1235</a> at Olympia,
assuming that the Periegete mistook oil-flasks for pomegranates
(ῥοιαί). But it hardly seems reasonable that such a small utensil,
which was used by athletes in general, could ever have been regarded
as a peculiar attribute of the wrestler. A similar attribute may have
been held in the outstretched hand of the half life-size archaic bronze
“Apollo” of the Sciarra Palace in Rome,<a id="FNanchor_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236" class="fnanchor">1236</a> and it occurs on other
statues.<a id="FNanchor_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237" class="fnanchor">1237</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Caps for Boxers, Pancratiasts, and Wrestlers.</span></h4>

<p>Often the boxer and pancratiast (and even wrestler)<a id="FNanchor_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238" class="fnanchor">1238</a> are represented
as wearing close-fitting caps, made up of thongs of leather or of solid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
leather. This, however, can scarcely be called a determining attribute.
Our best example of such a cap is afforded by an athlete head dating from
the first half of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, in the Capitoline Museum, Rome,<a id="FNanchor_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1239" class="fnanchor">1239</a>
formerly called a portrait of Juba II, who was the king of Numidia and
Mauretania from 25 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> to 23 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span> This ascription was based on the
barbarous look of the head and the fact that another head, discovered in
the Gymnasion of Ptolemy in Athens and thought to resemble it, was
assumed to be that of Juba, since Pausanias mentions one of that prince
there.<a id="FNanchor_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1240" class="fnanchor">1240</a> It is rather the head of an athlete engaged in putting on a cap.
This cap consists of three transverse leather pieces crossing the head
from side to side, one over the forehead, one over the crown, and the
third over the occiput, all three converging above the ears. A fourth
strap fastens them together and is drawn over the crown from forehead
to occiput. In the complete statue doubtless the hands were raised
to the head, grasping the straps near the ears to fasten them. This is,
therefore, an anticipation of the later <i>Diadoumenos</i> motive. We see
it in a statuette formerly in the Stroganoff collection in Rome, but
now in private possession in England,<a id="FNanchor_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241" class="fnanchor">1241</a> which represents an athlete
putting on a similar headdress. Though the arms of the statuette are
gone, remains of the two hands are seen touching the left ear and tying
the straps, one of which runs around the cranium above the swollen
right ear. With this complicated head-dress we may compare the
close-fitting cap—evidently of leather—pictured on an archaistic
Greek votive relief-in the Palazzo dei Conservatori, in Rome, which
represents an athlete washing his hands in a basin, which stands on a
tripod.<a id="FNanchor_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242" class="fnanchor">1242</a> Here the cap is fastened by two bands, one around and the
other under the chin. An object in the upper left corner of the relief,
enclosed in a frame, appears to be a victor crown adorned with bow-knots.
Such caps, used in wrestling, would make it impossible for an
opponent to grasp the hair; in boxing and the pankration it would protect
the head from injury. We saw that such a cap was pictured on a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
Munich kylix of the early fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> It is probable that such
caps were customary at a period before athletes lost their long hair and
that it was continued afterwards for various reasons. The little
statuette from Autun now in the Louvre (Fig. <a href="#f60">60</a>), representing a pancratiast,
has a close-fitting cap. The ring at the top shows that this
statuette was hung up—perhaps being used as a weight in a Roman
scale, or perhaps for adornment. In later days boys while practising
in the palæstra, but never at the public games, wore ear-lappets
(ἀμφωτίδες or ἐπωτίδες) to protect their ears, not dissimilar to those
worn in our day for protection against the cold. We see them on a
marble head, formerly in the possession of Fabretti.<a id="FNanchor_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243" class="fnanchor">1243</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Swollen Ear.</span></h4>

<p>We have lastly to speak of the swollen ear, which was an attribute
of victor statues, both primary and secondary, since it characterized
victors as such, and also early differentiated victors in various contests.
Swollen ears may have played a role as a characteristic attribute of
pugilists in early times.<a id="FNanchor_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244" class="fnanchor">1244</a> We found them on the Rayet head in the
Jacobsen collection (Fig. <a href="#f22">22</a>), which belongs to the last quarter of the
sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> and comes from the funerary statue of an athlete,
probably a boxer. In course of time, however, they came to characterize
pancratiasts, wrestlers,<a id="FNanchor_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor">1245</a> and athletes in general. The assumption,
then, that heads with swollen ears come from statues of boxers,<a id="FNanchor_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246" class="fnanchor">1246</a>
and that the boxer was known throughout Greek history as the “man
with the crushed ear” is erroneous.<a id="FNanchor_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247" class="fnanchor">1247</a> The earliest literary reference
to the bruised ear is in Plato.<a id="FNanchor_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248" class="fnanchor">1248</a> The philosopher used the term slightingly
of those who imitated Spartan customs, especially Spartan
boxing. The Lacedæmonians never boxed scientifically, but fought
with bare fists and without rules. Literary evidence, furthermore,
shows that bruised ears did not play the part in boxing matches which
other bruised features of the face did—the eyes, nose, mouth, teeth,
and chin. Vase-paintings sustain this evidence, for we often see
bloody noses and cuts on the cheeks and chin, but no crushed ears.<a id="FNanchor_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1249" class="fnanchor">1249</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
In short, the crushed ear was merely a professional characteristic, a
realistic detail, common to athletes of various sorts, and, as we shall
see, to warriors, gods, and heroes. To quote Homolle: “<i>La bouffissure
des oreilles ellemême n’est pas un trait personnel, mais un caractère professionnel;
elle ne désigne pas Agias, mais en général le lutteur. Cette
déformation peut atteindre même un dieu, s’il a pratiqué les exercices
gymnastiques et passé sa vie dans les luttes</i>”.<a id="FNanchor_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250" class="fnanchor">1250</a> It is found constantly on
athletic types of heads in sculpture, whether these represent gods or
mortals. A few examples will make this clear. The following heads
of athletes show the swollen ears: the bronze portrait head of a boxer
or pancratiast from Olympia, dating from the end of the fourth century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> or the beginning of the third (Fig. <a href="#f61">61</a> A and B);<a id="FNanchor_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1251" class="fnanchor">1251</a> the marble head

of the statue of the pancratiast Agias at Delphi (Pl. <a href="#p28">28</a> and Fig. <a href="#f68">68</a>) ;<a id="FNanchor_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253" class="fnanchor">1253</a>
that of the <i>Seated Boxer</i> in the Museo delle Terme in Rome (Pl. <a href="#p16">16</a> and

<p>When we consider heads of gods and heroes we find the swollen ears
on a variety of types. We see them on the so-called <i>Borghese Warrior</i>
of the Louvre (Fig. <a href="#f43">43</a>),<a id="FNanchor_1263"></a><a href="#Footnote_1263" class="fnanchor">1263</a> formerly called a <i>Gladiator</i>, and on the
marble statue of Kresilæan style in Munich, which has been known
since Brunn’s interpretation as <i>Diomedes</i> (carrying off the Palladion
from Troy) (Pl. <a href="#p21">21</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1264"></a><a href="#Footnote_1264" class="fnanchor">1264</a> This latter statue is a careful, though inexact,
Hadrianic copy of a famous work and is shown to represent the hero,
and not an athlete, by the mantle thrown over the arm. Skill in
the boxing match, the roughest and most dangerous of sports, is as
appropriate to <i>Diomedes</i> as to Herakles himself. The crushed ears
appear on the Dresden replica of this statue, a cast from the Mengs
collection, the original of which was once probably in England,<a id="FNanchor_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265" class="fnanchor">1265</a> but
do not appear on the poor copy in the Louvre.<a id="FNanchor_1266"></a><a href="#Footnote_1266" class="fnanchor">1266</a> They also appear on
the Myronian bust in the Riccardi Palace, Florence, which is a copy of
an original that was, perhaps, the forerunner of the Kresilæan
<i>Diomedes</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1267"></a><a href="#Footnote_1267" class="fnanchor">1267</a> Here again the garment thrown over the left shoulder
shows that a youthful hero, and not an athlete, is intended.</p>

<p>On heads of Herakles the swollen ears are very common. The
first dated representation of the hero with battered ears appears to be

A Parian marble head, encircled

<p>So far as we know, the statues of wrestlers, runners (except hoplitodromes),
and probably pancratiasts were not distinguished by special
attributes. In these cases the sculptor was obliged to express the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
type of contest in the figure itself. His problem, therefore, was to
represent the victor in the characteristic pose of the contest in which
he had won his victory, that is, by representing the statue as if in movement.
This brings us to the second division of our treatment of victor
statues, those which represented the victor not at rest, but in motion,
a scheme which, in course of time, was extended not only to victors
in wrestling and running, but to those in all contests, by representing
them in the very act of contending. The treatment of this class of
monuments will occupy the chief portion of Chapter IV.</p>

<p>Just when the important step of representing the victor in motion
instead of at rest was taken in Greek athletic sculpture we can not definitely
say. The statement of Cornelius Nepos that the statues of athletes
were first represented in movement in the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, after
the time of the Athenian general Chabrias—whose image he describes
as representing Chabrias in his favorite posture with his spear pointed
at the enemy and his shield on his knee—has long since been shown to
be worthless.<a id="FNanchor_1278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1278" class="fnanchor">1278</a> Nor is the assumption of many archæologists<a id="FNanchor_1279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1279" class="fnanchor">1279</a> that this
advance in the plastic art was taken over into athletic sculpture soon
after the statues of the <i>Tyrannicides</i> were set up at Athens, which represented
them in the midst of their impetuous onslaught on Hipparchos,
to be relied upon. These statues, however, occupy so important
a place in the history of Greek sculpture that we shall consider them
briefly in this connection.</p>

<h3>THE TYRANNICIDES.</h3>

<p>The bronze statues of the popular heroes Harmodios and Aristogeiton,
by the sculptor Antenor, were, in all probability, set up in the
Athenian agora in 506–5 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1280" class="fnanchor">1280</a> The group was carried off to Susa by
Xerxes in 480 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, and to replace it a new group, doubtless a free imitation
of the older one, and probably also of bronze, was set up in 477
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, the work of the sculptors Kritios and Nesiotes.<a id="FNanchor_1281"></a><a href="#Footnote_1281" class="fnanchor">1281</a> Nearly a century
and a half later the stolen group was restored to Athens by Alexander
the Great<a id="FNanchor_1282"></a><a href="#Footnote_1282" class="fnanchor">1282</a> and the two continued to stand side by side in Athens
down to the time of Pausanias. Neither of these groups has survived
to our time, but a late Roman marble copy of one, somewhat over life<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>size,
found in the ruins of Hadrian’s villa and now in Naples, gives us
a good idea of the original, despite restorations (Fig. <a href="#f32">32</a>, <i>Harmodios</i>).<a id="FNanchor_1283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1283" class="fnanchor">1283</a></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="f32"></a>
<img src="images/i_p174.jpg" width="350" height="542" alt="Statue of Harmodios" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span>—Statue of <i>Harmodios</i>. Museum of
Naples.</div></div>

<p>The reconstruction of this group is aided by several minor works
of art, reliefs, vase-paintings, coins, lead marks, etc., the number
of which shows that it was a common subject for Athenian artists.
Botho Graef, by a careful study of the female statue found on the
Akropolis in 1886 and inscribed as the work of Antenor, has shown
that the stylistic contrast between it and the Naples group is too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
great for the latter to be assigned to Antenor.<a id="FNanchor_1284"></a><a href="#Footnote_1284" class="fnanchor">1284</a> It is now, therefore,
the prevailing view that the Naples group reproduces the later
statues of Kritios and his associate.<a id="FNanchor_1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_1285" class="fnanchor">1285</a> We do not know, then, how the
older group looked, but we are certain that it was different from the
later one, for, in the years elapsing between the dates of the two, Attic
sculptors had become entirely free from the Ionic influence which we
discussed in the preceding chapter and which characterizes the female
statue of Antenor. Archaic stiffness, however, is still traceable in the
later group, for in the copy we see a work which is “concise, sinewy,
hard, and with strained lines,” in harmony with Lucian’s characterization
of the works of Hegias, Kritios, and Nesiotes.<a id="FNanchor_1286"></a><a href="#Footnote_1286" class="fnanchor">1286</a></p>

<p>The restorations of the Naples group, though right in the main, make
us doubtful as to the exact pose of the original figures.<a id="FNanchor_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1287" class="fnanchor">1287</a> Harmodios
has new arms, new right leg, and left leg below the knee, while Aristogeiton
has a Lysippan head in place of the original bearded one, to
correspond better with that of his companion. His left arm, with
the drapery hanging down, has been put on at a wrong angle, as he
should be represented holding a scabbard in the left hand and a sword
in the right. On a vase fragment (oinochoe) in Boston<a id="FNanchor_1288"></a><a href="#Footnote_1288" class="fnanchor">1288</a> both heroes
are making the onset, the younger one (Harmodios) in front of the
other, but in the original statues, they were probably making the
onset abreast, something that the vase-painter could not represent.<a id="FNanchor_1289"></a><a href="#Footnote_1289" class="fnanchor">1289</a></p>

<p>While the Akropolis ephebe, already discussed as showing Argive
influence (Fig. <a href="#f17">17</a>), still shows but little break with the law of “frontality”
formulated by J. Lange,<a id="FNanchor_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1290" class="fnanchor">1290</a> whereby an “imaginary line passing
through the skull, nose, backbone, and navel, dividing the body into
two symmetrical halves, is invariably straight, never bending to either
side,” the <i>Tyrannicides</i> have broken it completely. The ephebe has
his head slightly turned to one side, and, because of resemblances in
head and body to the figure of Harmodios, has been assigned to Kritios<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
or his school.<a id="FNanchor_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1291" class="fnanchor">1291</a> Another statue at rest ascribed to the same school is
the athlete in the Somzée collection, which reminds us of the Pelops
of the East Gable at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1292" class="fnanchor">1292</a> We have record of one more statue
by Kritios himself, which was represented in motion only less violent
than that of the <i>Tyrannicides</i>. Pausanias saw on the Akropolis of
Athens a statue by him of the hoplite runner Epicharinos, which represented
the athlete in the attitude of one practicing starts, perhaps
in the very pose of the Tuebingen statuette (Fig. <a href="#f42">42</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1293" class="fnanchor">1293</a></p>

<p>In the statues of the <i>Tyrannicides</i>, then, which might pass equally
well for typical athletes of the time, we have examples of statues in
motion at the end of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>; for the same violent action
must have characterized the earlier group of Antenor as the later
one. We have seen that the Aeginetan sculptors not only made pediment
groups in action at a date not later than that of the group by
Kritios and Nesiotes, but single figures still earlier. Thus the sculptor
Glaukias represented the Karystian boy boxer Glaukos in the act
of sparring with an imaginary opponent.<a id="FNanchor_1294"></a><a href="#Footnote_1294" class="fnanchor">1294</a> Though Glaukos won in
Ol. 65 (&#8239;=&#8239;520 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), his statue was set up later by his son, perhaps
as late as the end of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, or the beginning of the
fifth, as the <i>floruit</i> of the sculptor would show.<a id="FNanchor_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1295" class="fnanchor">1295</a> This is the oldest
example attested by literary evidence of an athlete statue in motion at
Olympia. Whether Glaukias got his motive from Antenor’s <i>Tyrannicides</i>,
or whether his work was the older, we can not determine, but
it is safe to say that this <i>genre</i> of statuary must have existed at Olympia
long before, as we know it did elsewhere. The Rampin head,
already discussed as a fragment of a victor statue, shows by the
turn of its neck that athlete statues represented in motion existed
at least as far back as the first half of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1296" class="fnanchor">1296</a></p>

<h3>ANTIQUITY OF MOTION STATUES IN GREECE.</h3>

<p>Apart from specifically athletic types, we know that statues in
motion, especially those representing winged figures, antedated the sixth
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> in Greece, and were, perhaps, coeval with the very origin
of Greek art.<a id="FNanchor_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1297" class="fnanchor">1297</a> We know that the oldest Egyptian art attempted to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
render the human body in motion. We may instance the limestone
funerary statuette dating from the Old Kingdom, which represents a slave
woman grinding corn,<a id="FNanchor_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298" class="fnanchor">1298</a> and similar figures found in the graves of Memphis.
In fact, the making of such statues ceased in Egyptian art after
the end of the Old Kingdom. While Assyro-Babylonian art represented
figures in motion only on reliefs, Cretan art, as we have seen in the first
chapter, showed the utmost skill in representing movement in figures in
the round. It used to be assumed that in Greek art motion statues
developed out of the archaic “Apollo” type through the gradual freeing
of legs and arms. Any such assumption is easily disproved by the
fact that figures in motion exist, which date back almost as far as figures
at rest. It is equally fallacious to argue that slight movement was
easier for the early artist to represent than violent movement, for just
the contrary was the case, so that in general the greater the movement
represented, the greater is the age of the given monument. Early vase-paintings
show that the early painter delighted in portraying free
movement.<a id="FNanchor_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_1299" class="fnanchor">1299</a> It may be that the vase-painter preceded the sculptor
in portraying movement, for it was easier to effect this in two dimensions
than in three. But that statues in motion were already known
at the beginning of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, at least, is shown by the
winged flying figure known as the <i>Nike</i> of Archermos,<a id="FNanchor_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300" class="fnanchor">1300</a> unearthed on
the island of Delos by the French in 1877, which is a masterpiece of
early Chian sculpture, perhaps coeval with the statue dedicated to
Artemis by Nikandre of Naxos, found a year later on Delos,<a id="FNanchor_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301" class="fnanchor">1301</a> even
though the latter appears more archaic. This earliest example of treating
a flying figure in Greek sculpture we find repeated almost unchanged
for a long time after, especially for <i>akroteria</i> figures on temples and in
the minor arts. We might mention the bronze statuette of the end of
the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, found on the Akropolis, which comes from the
edge of a vessel and represents a winged <i>Nike</i> springing through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
air, the legs in profile and the head and upper body turned to the front,
just as in the figure of Archermos.<a id="FNanchor_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1302" class="fnanchor">1302</a> Such figures completely disprove
the contention of Sikes that the Greek idea of a winged <i>Nike</i> did not
antedate the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303" class="fnanchor">1303</a> The early date of statues represented
in a lunging attitude, like the <i>Tyrannicides</i>, is also shown by the story
that Herakles destroyed his own statue by Daidalos in the agora of Elis,
because in the night he mistook it for an enemy lunging at him. The
scheme of combatants fighting with lances seems to have been native
to Rhodian art at the end of the seventh century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, for we see it
first on a painted terra-cotta plate in the British Museum, which
represents Hektor and Menelaos fighting for the body of Euphorbos.<a id="FNanchor_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1304" class="fnanchor">1304</a>
This pose was taken over into other arts, as we see it in the bronze
statuette of a warrior found in Dodona in 1880, now in the Antiquarium
in Berlin, which dates from the end of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, or the beginning
of the fifth.<a id="FNanchor_1305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1305" class="fnanchor">1305</a> All these examples are sufficient to show that representing
the human figure in motion was an ancient motive in Greek art.</p>

<h3>PYTHAGORAS AND MYRON.</h3>

<p>Besides Kritios, two other sculptors of the transitional period—Pythagoras
and Myron—gave a great impetus to the type of statue
in motion in the first half of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> Before proceeding
further we shall briefly consider their artistic activity.</p>

<p>The attempt to ascribe something tangible to Pythagoras of Rhegion
has often been made.<a id="FNanchor_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1306" class="fnanchor">1306</a> Practically all we really know about him is
that he was celebrated for his statues of athletes. Pausanias mentions
seven statues at Olympia of victors who won in many different events,
in running (including the hoplite-race), wrestling, boxing, and the
chariot-race; and Pliny, in giving a list of his works, praises the statue
of a pancratiast at Delphi.<a id="FNanchor_1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1307" class="fnanchor">1307</a> Thus Pausanias records the statues of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
the Sicilian wrestler Leontiskos, who won two victories in Ols. 81
and 82 (&#8239;=&#8239;456 and 452 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>);<a id="FNanchor_1308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1308" class="fnanchor">1308</a> of the boy boxer Protolaos of Mantinea,
who won in Ol. (?) 74 (&#8239;=&#8239;484 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>);<a id="FNanchor_1309"></a><a href="#Footnote_1309" class="fnanchor">1309</a> of the boxer Euthymos of Lokroi,
who won three times in Ols. 74, 76, 77 (&#8239;=&#8239;484, 476, 472 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>);<a id="FNanchor_1310"></a><a href="#Footnote_1310" class="fnanchor">1310</a> of Dromeus
of Stymphalos, who won the long foot-race (δόλιχος) twice in
Ols. (?) 80 and 81 (&#8239;=&#8239;460 and 456 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>);<a id="FNanchor_1311"></a><a href="#Footnote_1311" class="fnanchor">1311</a> of Astylos of Kroton, who won
the stade-race, the double foot-race (δίαυλος) three times, and the hoplite-race
twice in Ols. 73, 74, 75, 76 (&#8239;=&#8239;488–476 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>);<a id="FNanchor_1312"></a><a href="#Footnote_1312" class="fnanchor">1312</a> of the hoplite victor
Mnaseas of Kyrene, victor in Ol. 81 (&#8239;=&#8239;456 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>);<a id="FNanchor_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1313" class="fnanchor">1313</a> and of the latter’s
son Kratisthenes, who won the chariot-race in Ol. (?) 83 (&#8239;=&#8239;448 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_1314" class="fnanchor">1314</a>
Some of these statues at Olympia must have been represented at rest,
while others appear to have been represented in motion. Thus the
statue of Mnaseas—though it is possible that it was represented in
motion like that of Epicharinos by Kritios already mentioned—was
probably represented at rest, since Pausanias described it simply as
that of an ὁπλίτης ἀνήρ.<a id="FNanchor_1315"></a><a href="#Footnote_1315" class="fnanchor">1315</a> When we inquire into the style of Pythagoras
we do not find much that is definite to guide us. Besides the bare list
of his works, we have little except the statement of Diogenes Laertios
that he was the first to aim at rhythm and symmetry.<a id="FNanchor_1316"></a><a href="#Footnote_1316" class="fnanchor">1316</a> Nevertheless
many attempts have been made to identify his athlete statues with
existing copies. Waldstein’s interpretation of the <i>Choiseul-Gouffier</i>
statue in the British Museum (Pl. <a href="#p7A">7A</a>), and of the so-called <i>Apollo-on-the-Omphalos</i>
in Athens (Pl. <a href="#p7B">7B</a>), as copies of an original athlete statue,
is, as we have shown in the second chapter, well-founded, since the
muscular build and the coiffure of these statues betoken the athlete.
But his further attempt to show that the original was by Pythagoras,
and his identifying it with the statue of the boxer Euthymos at
Olympia, is not so reasonable.<a id="FNanchor_1317"></a><a href="#Footnote_1317" class="fnanchor">1317</a></p>

<p>The attempt to ascribe the head of a pancratiast from Perinthos in
Dresden (Fig. <a href="#f33">33</a>)<a id="FNanchor_1318"></a><a href="#Footnote_1318" class="fnanchor">1318</a> to Pythagoras is not convincing, though Furtwaengler
has included it in his provisional Pythagorean group,<a id="FNanchor_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1319" class="fnanchor">1319</a> as he does the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
boxer in the Louvre known as <i>Pollux</i> (Fig. <a href="#f58">58</a>),<a id="FNanchor_1320"></a><a href="#Footnote_1320" class="fnanchor">1320</a> the athlete of the Boboli
Gardens in Florence formerly called <i>Harmodios</i> by Benndorf,<a id="FNanchor_1321"></a><a href="#Footnote_1321" class="fnanchor">1321</a> and the
statue of an athlete of later style in Lansdowne House, London.<a id="FNanchor_1322"></a><a href="#Footnote_1322" class="fnanchor">1322</a> Other
<span class="figright250"><a id="f33"></a>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span>—Head of an Athlete,
from Perinthos. Albertinum,
Dresden.</span></span>
scholars have also connected the Perinthos
head with Pythagoras.<a id="FNanchor_1323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1323" class="fnanchor">1323</a> Hermann
brought it into relation with the
bust in the Riccardi Palace in Florence,
which, despite its swollen ears, we have
already classed as representing a hero
and not an athlete, because of the
garment thrown over the shoulder.<a id="FNanchor_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_1324" class="fnanchor">1324</a>
Furtwaengler tried to show that this
bust was Myronian in style, classing it
and the head of an athlete in Ince Blundell
Hall, Lancashire, England,<a id="FNanchor_1325"></a><a href="#Footnote_1325" class="fnanchor">1325</a> along
with that of the earlier <i>Diskobolos</i>, explaining
the acknowledged differences
in the three by Pliny’s statement that
Myron <i>primus multiplicasse veritatem
videtur</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1326"></a><a href="#Footnote_1326" class="fnanchor">1326</a> Arndt lists the Perinthos,
Riccardi, and Ince Blundell heads, together
with two others in the Jakobsen
collection in Copenhagen,<a id="FNanchor_1327"></a><a href="#Footnote_1327" class="fnanchor">1327</a> the head of
the so-called Pollux of the Louvre, a bearded head in Petrograd,<a id="FNanchor_1328"></a><a href="#Footnote_1328" class="fnanchor">1328</a> and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
the so-called head of <i>Peisistratos</i> in the Villa Albani, Rome,<a id="FNanchor_1329"></a><a href="#Footnote_1329" class="fnanchor">1329</a> as
works emanating from one school of sculptors—the differences being
explained by the many copyists. But to attempt to differentiate
within the group two different sculptors, Myron or Pythagoras, he
finds impossible, chiefly because we are dealing in every case with
copies and not with originals, and because in no case are we certain
that the head belongs to the torso on which it is set.<a id="FNanchor_1330"></a><a href="#Footnote_1330" class="fnanchor">1330</a> Still another
critic, A. Schober, classes together as more or less related works the
Riccardi, Ince Blundell, Perinthos, and Ny-Carlsberg heads, the Louvre
boxer (<i>Pollux</i>), Chinnery <i>Hermes</i> in the British Museum,<a id="FNanchor_1331"></a><a href="#Footnote_1331" class="fnanchor">1331</a> the Boboli
athlete, the athlete metamorphosed into a <i>Hermes</i> in the Loggia
Scoperta of the Vatican, and the Lansdowne athlete, and finds them
all Myronian. He believes the Perinthos head to be the prototype
of the Riccardi and Ince Blundell heads.<a id="FNanchor_1332"></a><a href="#Footnote_1332" class="fnanchor">1332</a></p>

<p>In all this confusion of opinion as to the style of Pythagoras, and in
the absence of any fixed criterion of judgment furnished by an original
authenticated work, it seems hazardous to ascribe this or that sculpture
to this little-known artist. The difficulty of separating Myron and
Pythagoras is even greater than that which confronts us in trying to
distinguish works of Lysippos and Skopas in the next century. We
may some day recover a genuine Pythagorean athlete statue, though
this is extremely improbable now that we have no more to expect from
Olympia and Delphi, where most of his statues appear to have stood.
But despite the difficulty, many identifications of his Olympia statues
have been suggested, some of which we shall now mention.</p>

<p>As Pausanias says that the victor Mnaseas was surnamed <i>Libys</i>, the
Libyan, and that his statue was by Pythagoras, it may be that this is
the statue mentioned by Pliny in the words: <i>[Pythagoras] fecit ...
et Libyn, puerum tenentem tabellam eodem loco (= Olympiae) et mala
ferentem nudum.</i><a id="FNanchor_1333"></a><a href="#Footnote_1333" class="fnanchor">1333</a> However, in that case we can not connect the
words <i>Libyn</i> and <i>puerum</i>, since one represented a man and the other a
boy.<a id="FNanchor_1334"></a><a href="#Footnote_1334" class="fnanchor">1334</a> Consequently, Pliny is speaking of three different statues, and
not two, by this artist. Reisch believes that the statues of the boy
and the nude man were represented at rest,<a id="FNanchor_1335"></a><a href="#Footnote_1335" class="fnanchor">1335</a> the boy bearing a tablet
(<i>i. e.</i>, an iconic <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>πινάκιον) in his hand, like the Athenian youth appearing
on a vase-painting in Munich.<a id="FNanchor_1336"></a><a href="#Footnote_1336" class="fnanchor">1336</a> Another scholar, L. von Urlichs, formerly
identified the boy carrying the tablet with the statue of Protolaos at
Olympia,<a id="FNanchor_1337"></a><a href="#Footnote_1337" class="fnanchor">1337</a> explaining the tablet as a means of characterizing the young
learner. He changed his theory later,<a id="FNanchor_1338"></a><a href="#Footnote_1338" class="fnanchor">1338</a> when, in consequence of the
discovery of the Corinthian tablets, he called it a votive tablet. His
son, H. L. von Urlichs, agreed with him because of a passage in the collection
of <i>Proverbs</i> by Zenobios, the sophist of Hadrian’s age,<a id="FNanchor_1339"></a><a href="#Footnote_1339" class="fnanchor">1339</a> according
to which the marble statue of <i>Nemesis</i> at Rhamnous by Pheidias’
favorite pupil, the Parian sculptor Agorakritos,<a id="FNanchor_1340"></a><a href="#Footnote_1340" class="fnanchor">1340</a> held an apple-branch
in her left hand, from which a small tablet containing the artist’s name
was suspended, and also because certain coins of Syracuse and Catania
represent Nike as carrying a tablet hung by a ribbon, on which the coin-striker’s
name was engraved.<a id="FNanchor_1341"></a><a href="#Footnote_1341" class="fnanchor">1341</a> The same scholar further identified the
nude man carrying the apples with the statue of Dromeus at Olympia.
Since Pliny does not expressly say that the statue of the nude man was
at Olympia, even though the sense of the passage inclines us to think
it was, L. von Urlichs interprets the apples in the hand as an additional
prize at Delphi, and so makes the statue that of a Pythian victor.<a id="FNanchor_1342"></a><a href="#Footnote_1342" class="fnanchor">1342</a>
All such identifications are based on too uncertain premises.</p>

<p>That Pythagoras did make statues in motion is proved by his statue
of a limping man at Syracuse mentioned by Pliny<a id="FNanchor_1343"></a><a href="#Footnote_1343" class="fnanchor">1343</a> in very realistic
terms. We know of other statues by him representing athletes in
motion only by inference. Thus, in the passage just quoted, Pliny says
that he surpassed Myron with his Delphian pancratiast, which appears,
inasmuch as Pliny merely calls the statue a pancratiast without mentioning
any attribute, to have been represented in the characteristic lunging
pose.<a id="FNanchor_1344"></a><a href="#Footnote_1344" class="fnanchor">1344</a> However, we can not say definitely, since the contemporary
statue of the pancratiast Kallias, by Mikon of Athens, was represented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
in the attitude of rest, as we learn from the footprints on its recovered
base.<a id="FNanchor_1345"></a><a href="#Footnote_1345" class="fnanchor">1345</a> Pliny also says that Pythagoras surpassed with his Delphian
pancratiast his own statue of Leontiskos,<a id="FNanchor_1346"></a><a href="#Footnote_1346" class="fnanchor">1346</a> a statement which similarly
appears to mark the latter as a statue in motion. Reisch assumes
that the statue of Euthymos was in motion, since Pausanias says it
was an ἀνδριὰς θέας ἐς τὰ μάλιστα ἄξιος.<a id="FNanchor_1347"></a><a href="#Footnote_1347" class="fnanchor">1347</a> On the whole, then, we may
assume that Pythagoras was a sculptor who represented many of his
victors in the attitude of motion.</p>

<p>Love of movement also characterized the artistic temperament of
Myron, even though we know that he represented gods, heroes, and even
athletes, at rest. Thus coins show that Athena in his <i>Marsyas</i> group
was represented as standing in a tranquil pose.<a id="FNanchor_1348"></a><a href="#Footnote_1348" class="fnanchor">1348</a> Similarly the Riccardi
bust in Florence, already discussed, which may be Myronian,
comes from a statue of a hero shown in an attitude of rest. Myron was
the first Greek sculptor to make his statues and groups self-sufficient,<a id="FNanchor_1349"></a><a href="#Footnote_1349" class="fnanchor">1349</a>
that is, he gave to them a concentration which does not allow the
spectator’s attention to wander. We readily see this new principle
in art when we compare the <i>Diskobolos</i> and the group of the <i>Tyrannicides</i>.
In the latter our attention is not concentrated, for a third figure,
that of the tyrant on whom the onset is being made, is required in imagination
to complete the group. We have no originals from Myron’s hand,
but we are in far better case in regard to his work than in regard to that
of Pythagoras, since we have unmistakable copies of two of his greatest
works, the <i>Marsyas</i> and the <i>Diskobolos</i>. In them there is little
trace of the archaic stiffness that is still visible in the <i>Tyrannicides</i>.
Both of these works are represented in violent action, and in both there
is complete concentration. While the <i>Diskobolos</i> represents a trained
palæstra athlete executing a graceful movement, the <i>Marsyas</i> represents
a wild Satyr of the woods, wholly untrained and controlled by
savage passions, in the moment of fear.<a id="FNanchor_1350"></a><a href="#Footnote_1350" class="fnanchor">1350</a> In the <i>Diskobolos</i> the face is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
impassive, being little affected by the violent movement of the body—a
contrast only partly to be explained as due to the copyist; in the
<i>Marsyas</i>, on the contrary, there is complete harmony between the
facial expression and the violent action of the body.</p>

<p>Since we are chiefly dependent for our knowledge of Myron’s athletic
work on the marble copies of the <i>Diskobolos</i>, which represents a new era
in athletic art, and since this statue is perhaps the most famous athletic
statue of all times, it will be well to speak of it here at some length.
It is not, so far as we know, the statue of any particular victor, but
rather a study in athletic sculpture.<a id="FNanchor_1351"></a><a href="#Footnote_1351" class="fnanchor">1351</a> Of this work there are twelve full size
replicas and several statuettes. We shall discuss only those which
give us the best idea of the lost original. The most faithful copy is the
superb marble statue in the Palazzo Lancellotti, Rome, discovered on
the Esquiline in 1781 (head seen in Pl. <a href="#p23">23</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1352"></a><a href="#Footnote_1352" class="fnanchor">1352</a> As the head has never been
broken away from the body, this copy preserves the original pose,
whereas all other copies have the head turned in the wrong direction.<a id="FNanchor_1353"></a><a href="#Footnote_1353" class="fnanchor">1353</a>
The head and face preserve Attic proportions and the treatment of the
hair and muscles differs from that of the other copies, which disclose
later elements. The hair, in particular, shows signs of archaism, just
as it must have been treated in the original, as evinced by Pliny’s
criticism.<a id="FNanchor_1354"></a><a href="#Footnote_1354" class="fnanchor">1354</a> The most carefully worked copy, however, is the Parian
marble torso, which was found in 1906 at Castel Porziano, the site of
the ancient Laurentum, and is now in the Museo delle Terme, Rome
(Pl. <a href="#p22">22</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1355"></a><a href="#Footnote_1355" class="fnanchor">1355</a> This torso was already restored in antiquity. Since the
villa in which it was found was built in Augustus’ day and was restored
in the second century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span>, we have the approximate dates both of the
origin and restoration of the statue. A weak copy, discovered in Tivoli
in 1791, is in the Sala della Biga of the Vatican; the head, left arm, and
right leg below the knee have been restored, the head wrongly (Fig.
34).<a id="FNanchor_1356"></a><a href="#Footnote_1356" class="fnanchor">1356</a> A Græco-Roman copy discovered also in 1791, in Hadrian’s
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
villa, is in the British Museum (Fig. <a href="#f35">35</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1357"></a><a href="#Footnote_1357" class="fnanchor">1357</a> Here the head, although
antique, belongs to another copy, and has been set upon the torso
wrongly, in such a way that the throat has two Adam’s apples. It
looks straight to the ground and not upward as in the Lancellotti copy.
There is a better replica of the torso in the Capitoline Museum, which
formerly belonged to the French sculptor Étienne Mounot (1658–1733),
who wrongly restored it as a falling warrior. It agrees in
accuracy with the Lancellotti copy, though it is dry and lifeless, and
is a better guide to the original than either the Vatican or British<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
Museum replicas.<a id="FNanchor_1358"></a><a href="#Footnote_1358" class="fnanchor">1358</a> A combination of these and other copies gives
us an excellent idea of the original bronze. In Pl. <a href="#p23">23</a> we give a
combination of the Vatican torso and the Lancellotti head from a cast
in Munich.<a id="FNanchor_1359"></a><a href="#Footnote_1359" class="fnanchor">1359</a> Perhaps a better combination is that given by Bulle<a id="FNanchor_1360"></a><a href="#Footnote_1360" class="fnanchor">1360</a>
from a cast made up of the delle Terme body, the Lancellotti head,
the right arm and the diskos from the Casa Buonarroti in Florence,
the feet from the British Museum copy and the fingers of the left hand
being freely restored.</p>

<p>The pose of the Lancellotti copy agrees with Lucian’s description of
the original: “Surely, said I, you do not speak of the quoit-thrower
who stoops in the attitude of one who is making his cast, turning round
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
toward the hand that holds the quoit, and bending the other knee
gently beneath him, like one who will rise erect as he hurls the quoit?”<a id="FNanchor_1361"></a><a href="#Footnote_1361" class="fnanchor">1361</a>
That the head of the original was turned back as in the Lancellotti copy,
and not downwards, as in the Vatican, British Museum and other replicas,
is shown by this description, which is corroborated by two bronze
statuettes in Munich and Arolsen<a id="FNanchor_1362"></a><a href="#Footnote_1362" class="fnanchor">1362</a> and by a gem in the British Museum.<a id="FNanchor_1363"></a><a href="#Footnote_1363" class="fnanchor">1363</a>
Myron chose the most difficult, but at the same time the most characteristic,
moment in swinging the diskos, the moment which combines
the idea of rest and motion. The quoit has been swung back as far as
it will go. The momentary pause before it is hurled forward suggests
rest and at the same time implies motion, both that which has preceded
and that which is to follow. It is this short pause at the end of the
backward swing which the sculptor has fixed in the bronze. The right
arm is stretched backwards as far as possible and draws with it the
body with the left arm and head; in another instant the diskos will be
hurled and the tension on the right leg relaxed. The original statue
rested upon the right foot; the tree trunk is a necessary addition
to the marble copies. As Greek art was mostly characterized by
repose, we are not surprised that such a daring effect received the censure
of the ancient critics. Quintilian says that if any one blames the
statue for its labored effect, he is wrong, since the novelty and the difficulty
of the work are its chief merits.<a id="FNanchor_1364"></a><a href="#Footnote_1364" class="fnanchor">1364</a> For a statue of the transitional
stage of Greek sculpture it is remarkably bold; only in imagination can
we see the action by which the body has got into this position and by
which it will recover its equilibrium. It illustrates a principle laid
down by Lessing in the <i>Laokoön</i>: “Of ever changing nature the artist
can use only a single moment and this from a single point of view. And
as his work is meant to be looked at not for an instant, but with long
consideration, he must choose the most fruitful moment, and the most
fruitful point of view, that, to wit, which leaves the power of imagination
free.”<a id="FNanchor_1365"></a><a href="#Footnote_1365" class="fnanchor">1365</a></p>

<p>Myron was the sculptor of five statues for four victors at Olympia,
one of a pancratiast, another of a boxer, a third of a runner, and two of
a victor in the hoplite-race and the chariot-race.<a id="FNanchor_1366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1366" class="fnanchor">1366</a> Pliny also says that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
Myron made statues of pentathletes and pancratiasts at Delphi.<a id="FNanchor_1367"></a><a href="#Footnote_1367" class="fnanchor">1367</a> Thus
he showed as much versatility as Pythagoras in the representation of
victors in different contests. None of these statues has survived and the
identification of existing Roman copies with any of them is, of course,
highly problematical. Thus, a little further on we make the suggestion
that the statue of the boxer in the Louvre, commonly known as <i>Pollux</i>
(Fig. <a href="#f58">58</a>), may be, because of its Myronian character, the statue of the
unknown Arkadian boxer at Olympia mentioned by Pausanias (in connection
with the boy boxer Philippos) as the work of Myron.<a id="FNanchor_1368"></a><a href="#Footnote_1368" class="fnanchor">1368</a> Pliny, in
the passage just cited, also mentions statues of <i>pristae</i> by Myron, a
word which has given rise to many interpretations: <i>e. g.</i>, sea-monsters
(<i>pristes</i> or <i>pistres</i>), men working with a cross-cut saw (<i>pristae</i>), players at
see-saw (<i>pristae</i>?),<a id="FNanchor_1369"></a><a href="#Footnote_1369" class="fnanchor">1369</a> and boxers (<i>pyctae</i>).<a id="FNanchor_1370"></a><a href="#Footnote_1370" class="fnanchor">1370</a> The manuscripts are unanimous
for <i>pristae</i>, and hence it is probable that a realistic group by Myron is
meant, since Myron is often classed as a realist in opposition to Polykleitos,
the idealist. Long ago Dalecampius, followed in recent years
by Furtwaengler,<a id="FNanchor_1371"></a><a href="#Footnote_1371" class="fnanchor">1371</a> believed that these <i>pristae</i> formed a votive offering,
and H. L. von Urlichs has shown that a group of sawyers as the dedication
of some master-builder is quite in harmony with fifth-century traditions.<a id="FNanchor_1372"></a><a href="#Footnote_1372" class="fnanchor">1372</a>
H. Stuart Jones<a id="FNanchor_1373"></a><a href="#Footnote_1373" class="fnanchor">1373</a> connects the words <i>Perseum et pristas</i> of Pliny’s
text, and follows the theory of Mayer<a id="FNanchor_1374"></a><a href="#Footnote_1374" class="fnanchor">1374</a> that the carpenters or sawyers
were a part of a group, which represented the inclosure of Danaë and
Perseus in the chest.</p>

<p>While the athletic statues in motion by Pythagoras and Myron
became models for later sculptors, especially in the following century,<a id="FNanchor_1375"></a><a href="#Footnote_1375" class="fnanchor">1375</a>
the rest statues of Polykleitos still remained in vogue in works by members
of his family and school down through the fourth century, as
we have seen in our treatment of the Argive-Sikyonian sculptors at
Olympia.</p>

<h3>MOTION STATUES REPRESENTING VICTORS IN
VARIOUS CONTESTS.</h3>

<p>We shall now review the types of victor statues, which reproduced in
their pose the various contests, <i>i. e.</i>, statues in motion. We shall find<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
it convenient to follow in the main the order of contests as they appear
on the Oxyrhynchus Papyrus<a id="FNanchor_1376"></a><a href="#Footnote_1376" class="fnanchor">1376</a>—the stade-race (στάδιον), double race
(δίαυλος), long race (δόλιχος), pentathlon (πένταθλον), wrestling,
(πάλη), boxing (πύξ), pankration (παγκράτιον), hoplite-race (ὁπλίτης),
chariot-race (τέθριππον), and horse-race (κέλης)—except that we shall
class the four running races (nos. 1, 2, 3, and 11) together and include
the three boys’ contests (παίδων στάδιον, πάλη, πύξ, nos. 8, 9, 10) under
the corresponding men’s events. The classification of competitors by
ages (ἡλικίαι), which varied at different festivals, will need a word of
explanation. While athletes at Nemea, the Isthmus, and Delphi were
divided into three classes, παῖδες, ἀγένειοι, and ἄνδρες,<a id="FNanchor_1377"></a><a href="#Footnote_1377" class="fnanchor">1377</a> at Olympia
they were divided into two, παῖδες and ἄνδρες.<a id="FNanchor_1378"></a><a href="#Footnote_1378" class="fnanchor">1378</a> At local competitions
there was a more elaborate classification. Thus at the Bœotian
<i>Erotidia</i>, boys were divided into younger and older;<a id="FNanchor_1379"></a><a href="#Footnote_1379" class="fnanchor">1379</a> at the games held
on the island of Chios there were five divisions, boys, younger, middle,
and older ephebes, and men;<a id="FNanchor_1380"></a><a href="#Footnote_1380" class="fnanchor">1380</a> and at the Athenian <i>Theseia</i>, the boys
were divided into first, second, and third classes, while an open contest
also existed for boys of any age.<a id="FNanchor_1381"></a><a href="#Footnote_1381" class="fnanchor">1381</a> Girls at the <i>Heraia</i> at Olympia
were similarly divided into three classes.<a id="FNanchor_1382"></a><a href="#Footnote_1382" class="fnanchor">1382</a> Plato proposed three classes
of athletes in his <i>Laws</i>—παιδικοί, ἄνδρες, and a third class, ἀγένειοι,
between boys and men.<a id="FNanchor_1383"></a><a href="#Footnote_1383" class="fnanchor">1383</a> The classification of athletes at Athens into
παῖδες and ἄνδρες, adopted by Boeckh, Dittenberger, and Dumont,<a id="FNanchor_1384"></a><a href="#Footnote_1384" class="fnanchor">1384</a> is
now the one generally followed. According to it the παῖδες were subdivided
into three classes, those τῆς πρώτης ἡλικίας, τῆς δευτέρας, and
τῆς τρίτης; and so the ἀγένειοι were merely the παῖδες της τρίτης
ἡλικίας. The boys, including the ἀγένειοι, ranged from 12 to 18 years
old; at 18 they became ἔφηβοι or ἄνδρες.<a id="FNanchor_1385"></a><a href="#Footnote_1385" class="fnanchor">1385</a> We have already seen that
the age of boy victors at Olympia was over 17 and under 20.<a id="FNanchor_1386"></a><a href="#Footnote_1386" class="fnanchor">1386</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>As we have already remarked in an earlier chapter, we are mostly
indebted to Pausanias for our knowledge of the victor statues at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_1387"></a><a href="#Footnote_1387" class="fnanchor">1387</a>
He mentions in his <i>periegesis</i> of the Altis 192 monuments,
which were erected to 187 victors.<a id="FNanchor_1388"></a><a href="#Footnote_1388" class="fnanchor">1388</a> Some of these victors won in more
than one contest, so that there are 258 different victories recorded in
all. In the following sections we shall see how these were distributed
among the various contests.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Runners: Stadiodromoi, Diaulodromoi, Dolichodromoi.</span></h4>

<p>Running races formed at all times a part of the Greek games and of
the exercises of the youth in the gymnasia and palæstræ. A scholiast
on Pindar<a id="FNanchor_1389"></a><a href="#Footnote_1389" class="fnanchor">1389</a> says that the running race had its origin in the first celebration
of the Eleusinian mysteries. It figures largely in mythology,
especially at Olympia, which also shows its antiquity.<a id="FNanchor_1390"></a><a href="#Footnote_1390" class="fnanchor">1390</a> In historic
times many varieties of running developed, but four chief ones were
practised at the great games.<a id="FNanchor_1391"></a><a href="#Footnote_1391" class="fnanchor">1391</a> First there was the simple stade-race
(στάδιον, δρόμος), which was merely the length of the stadion or 600
Greek feet, corresponding with the running race of Homer.<a id="FNanchor_1392"></a><a href="#Footnote_1392" class="fnanchor">1392</a> Then there
was the double race (δίαυλος), twice as long as the preceding, to the
end of the course and back again.<a id="FNanchor_1393"></a><a href="#Footnote_1393" class="fnanchor">1393</a> The long race (δόλιχος, ὁ μακρὸς
δρόμος), which Philostratos derives from the institution of messenger
runners (<i>hemerodromoi</i>),<a id="FNanchor_1394"></a><a href="#Footnote_1394" class="fnanchor">1394</a> is variously given as seven, twelve, fourteen,
twenty, and twenty-four stades in length, <i>i. e.</i>, from about four-fifths
of a mile to nearly three miles.<a id="FNanchor_1395"></a><a href="#Footnote_1395" class="fnanchor">1395</a> Lastly there was the race in armor
(ὁπλιτοδρόμος,<a id="FNanchor_1396"></a><a href="#Footnote_1396" class="fnanchor">1396</a>  ὁπλίτης,<a id="FNanchor_1397"></a><a href="#Footnote_1397" class="fnanchor">1397</a> ἀσπίς.<a id="FNanchor_1398"></a><a href="#Footnote_1398" class="fnanchor">1398</a>) The long race was instituted not so
much as a contest of fleetness as of endurance. At Olympia only men
were admitted, though there was such a race for boys at Delphi.<a id="FNanchor_1399"></a><a href="#Footnote_1399" class="fnanchor">1399</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
Cretans were famed in this style of running.<a id="FNanchor_1400"></a><a href="#Footnote_1400" class="fnanchor">1400</a> The race in armor,
which was a double race or two stades at Olympia, we shall discuss
further on. Probably the boys’ stade-race at Olympia was shorter
than that of the men. Plato, who gives the historic division of running
races outlined above, has the boys run one-half of the men’s course
and the ephebes (ἀγένειοι) two-thirds.<a id="FNanchor_1401"></a><a href="#Footnote_1401" class="fnanchor">1401</a> Just so Pausanias has the
girl runners at the Olympia <i>Heraia</i> run one-sixth of the men’s stadion.<a id="FNanchor_1402"></a><a href="#Footnote_1402" class="fnanchor">1402</a></p>

<p>At Olympia, as at the <i>Panathenaia</i> in Athens and probably elsewhere,
the first event preceding all others was the stade-race. Pausanias
says that it was the oldest event at Olympia,<a id="FNanchor_1403"></a><a href="#Footnote_1403" class="fnanchor">1403</a> and it existed there
all through antiquity from the first recorded Olympiad (&#8239;=&#8239;776 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>),

stade-race for men was honored above all other events at Olympia,
because the winner became ἐπώνυμος for the Olympiad and because his
name occurs in the lists of Africanus for every Olympiad, is incorrect.
In two passages Thukydides cites Olympic pancratiasts for dates,<a id="FNanchor_1406"></a><a href="#Footnote_1406" class="fnanchor">1406</a>
and in the earliest inscription which makes use of Olympiads for
chronology the later introduced pankration is the event used.<a id="FNanchor_1407"></a><a href="#Footnote_1407" class="fnanchor">1407</a> The
literary supremacy of Athens, where, at the <i>Panathenaia</i>, the stade-race
was the most important event, doubtless helped later in making
the stade runner at Olympia eponymous. This custom, however, was
not generally employed before the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
won 32 victories, which makes this event third in importance, next
after boxing and wrestling. He mentions 7 victors in the double race
with 11 victories, and 5 victors in the long race with 8 victories.
He also mentions 12 hoplite victors with 14 victories. Consequently,
in all four running events there, he records 48 victors with 65 victories,
which brings the running races only to second place in importance
at Olympia, ranking next after boxing.<a id="FNanchor_1412"></a><a href="#Footnote_1412" class="fnanchor">1412</a> The ordinary sprinter or
<i>stadiodromos</i>, and the double sprinter, <i>diaulodromos</i> or <i>hoplitodromos</i>,
naturally ran differently from the endurance runner or <i>dolichodromos</i>.
Panathenaic vases clearly show this difference. Thus while the sprinter
swung his arms violently, spreading the fingers apart and touching
the ground only with his toes<a id="FNanchor_1413"></a><a href="#Footnote_1413" class="fnanchor">1413</a> (Figs. 36A and 37, left), the endurance
runner, who had to conserve his strength to the last, ran with a long
stride, holding his arms bent at the elbow and close to the body, his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
fists doubled and his body slightly bent forward, its weight resting on
the ball of the foot, the heel being raised only a little. Thus Philostratos
says that the <i>dolichodromoi</i> ran with their hands extended
and with their fists balled, but that at the finish they also swung
their arms violently like wings.<a id="FNanchor_1414"></a><a href="#Footnote_1414" class="fnanchor">1414</a> The race (showing balled fists) is
seen on a Panathenaic amphora dating from the archonship of Nikeratos
(333 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), now in the British Museum, and on another of the
sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, pictured in Fig. <a href="#f37">37</a> (right).<a id="FNanchor_1415"></a><a href="#Footnote_1415" class="fnanchor">1415</a> In the <i>diaulos</i> the
movement was less violent. Thus on an Athens vase inscribed, “I am
a diaulos runner,”<a id="FNanchor_1416"></a><a href="#Footnote_1416" class="fnanchor">1416</a> the movement is between that of a sprinter and
an endurance runner. It seems probable that this difference in the style
of running was similarly shown in sculpture.<a id="FNanchor_1417"></a><a href="#Footnote_1417" class="fnanchor">1417</a> We shall next consider
certain sculptural monuments which represent runners.</p>

<p>The typical scheme for archaic and archaistic art was to represent
the runner with one knee nearly touching the ground, the upper log
forming a right angle with the lower, the other leg being perpendicular
to the upper. This scheme appears on many vases and reliefs and in
statuettes and statues.<a id="FNanchor_1418"></a><a href="#Footnote_1418" class="fnanchor">1418</a> This old method of depicting runners was kept
up by vase-painters down to the time of the red-figured masters.<a id="FNanchor_1419"></a><a href="#Footnote_1419" class="fnanchor">1419</a> We
see them on many reliefs, <i>e. g.</i>, on the Ionic-Greek reliefs on the three
archaic bronze tripods of the middle of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> in the possession
of Mr. James Loeb;<a id="FNanchor_1420"></a><a href="#Footnote_1420" class="fnanchor">1420</a> on a small bronze relief in the Metropolitan
Museum in New York which represents a winged Boreas;<a id="FNanchor_1421"></a><a href="#Footnote_1421" class="fnanchor">1421</a> and on the
marble funerary stele of the so-called dying hoplite runner found in
1902 near the Theseion, and now in the National Museum in Athens.<a id="FNanchor_1422"></a><a href="#Footnote_1422" class="fnanchor">1422</a>
Almost the same position as that of the figure on this Athenian relief is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
seen in a small bronze in the Metropolitan Museum, whose primitive
features and solidly massed hair date it in the early part of the sixth
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_1423"></a><a href="#Footnote_1423" class="fnanchor">1423</a> Another slightly larger bronze in the same museum represents
Herakles running in a kneeling posture.<a id="FNanchor_1424"></a><a href="#Footnote_1424" class="fnanchor">1424</a> Because a spearman
is incongruous behind a bowman, Kalkmann<a id="FNanchor_1425"></a><a href="#Footnote_1425" class="fnanchor">1425</a> and Furtwaengler<a id="FNanchor_1426"></a><a href="#Footnote_1426" class="fnanchor">1426</a> have
interpreted the two kneeling figures near either end of the West gable
of the temple on Aegina as archaic runners (see Fig. <a href="#f21">21</a>, left). We may
further compare with these figures the positions, though not the
motives, of two others from the West gable at Olympia,<a id="FNanchor_1427"></a><a href="#Footnote_1427" class="fnanchor">1427</a> as well as
that of the kneeling bowman <i>Herakles</i> from the East gable of the
temple on Aegina.<a id="FNanchor_1428"></a><a href="#Footnote_1428" class="fnanchor">1428</a> In this connection we shall also mention the life-size
marble torso of a kneeling youth found in Nero’s villa at Subiaco
in 1884 and now in the Museo delle Terme, Rome (Pl. <a href="#p24">24</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1429"></a><a href="#Footnote_1429" class="fnanchor">1429</a> This
statue, representing a boy of delicate build apparently striding forward
with the right leg and bending the left so that the knee nearly touches
the ground, has been regarded by some scholars<a id="FNanchor_1430"></a><a href="#Footnote_1430" class="fnanchor">1430</a> as a runner, whose
pose copies the archaic manner, being historically the last example
known of its use in sculpture. The right shoulder is turned backward
and the head, now missing, was turned back and upwards; the right
arm is raised high and twisted about with the palm of the hand facing
backward, the left arm extended with its hand in some way related to
the right knee. The impression made on the spectator is that of a boy
bending aside as if to ward off some danger. It is an excellent piece of
work, evidently the marble copy of an original bronze. This has been variously
assigned to the fifth, fourth, and even later centuries <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>,<a id="FNanchor_1431"></a><a href="#Footnote_1431" class="fnanchor">1431</a> and
interpreted in various ways<a id="FNanchor_1432"></a><a href="#Footnote_1432" class="fnanchor">1432</a>—as a Niobid,<a id="FNanchor_1433"></a><a href="#Footnote_1433" class="fnanchor">1433</a> as Ganymedes swooped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
down upon by the eagle,<a id="FNanchor_1434"></a><a href="#Footnote_1434" class="fnanchor">1434</a> as Hylas drawn into the water by nymphs
when he was filling his pitcher,<a id="FNanchor_1435"></a><a href="#Footnote_1435" class="fnanchor">1435</a> as a ball-player,<a id="FNanchor_1436"></a><a href="#Footnote_1436" class="fnanchor">1436</a> as a boy throwing
a lasso,<a id="FNanchor_1437"></a><a href="#Footnote_1437" class="fnanchor">1437</a> as a gable figure,<a id="FNanchor_1438"></a><a href="#Footnote_1438" class="fnanchor">1438</a> as a runner at the games, etc. Many of
these interpretations are purely fanciful; the last is, perhaps, as good
as any, though the strongly turned upper body seems not quite fitted
to it. If it represents a runner, the sculptor has reproduced the well-known
archaic pose.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Statue of the Runner Ladas.</span></h4>

<p>We shall next consider the famous statue of the runner Ladas by
Myron, which is unfortunately known to us only from literary evidence,
but which attained in antiquity an even greater fame than his nameless
<i>Diskobolos</i>, since it portrayed even more tension than that wonderful
work. Its fame was partly due to the picturesque story how the
victory cost the runner his life, for he died of strain while on his way
home to Sparta; it was also due in no less degree to the striking way in
which the victor was depicted.<a id="FNanchor_1439"></a><a href="#Footnote_1439" class="fnanchor">1439</a></p>

<p>Two fourth-century epigrams tell us of the statue. The first of these
runs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Λάδας τὸ στάδιον εἴθ’ ἥλατο, εἴτε διέπτη,</div>
<div class="line">οὐδὲ φράσαι δυνατόν· δαιμόνιον τὸ τάχος.</div>
<div class="line">[ὁ ψόφος ἦν ὕσπληγγος ἐν οὔασι, καὶ στεφανοῦτο</div>
<div class="line">Λάδας καὶ κάμνων δάκτυλον οὐ προέβη.]<a id="FNanchor_1440"></a><a href="#Footnote_1440" class="fnanchor">1440</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The second epigram, naming Myron as the sculptor, runs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Οἷος ἔης φεύγων τὸν ὑπήνεμον, ἔμπνοε Λάδα,</div>
<div class="line">Θῦμον, ἐπ’ ἀκροτάτῳ πνεύματι θεὶς ὄνυχα,</div>
<div class="line">τοῖον ἐχάλκευσέν σε Μύρων, ἐπὶ παντὶ χαράξας</div>
<div class="line">σώματι Πισαίου προσδοκίην στεφάνου.</div>

<div class="caption">Statue of a Kneeling Youth, from Subiaco. Museo delle Terme, Rome.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>To these verses are added the following, which Benndorf thinks
belonged to another epigram on the same statue:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">πλήρης ἐλπίδος ἐστίν, ἄκροις δ’ ἐπὶ χείλεσιν ἆσθμα</div>
<div class="line">ἐμφαίνει κοίλων ἔνδοθεν ἐκ λαγόνων.</div>
<div class="line">πηδήσει τάχα χαλκὸς ἐπὶ στέφος, οὐδὲ καθέξει</div>
<div class="line">ἁ βάσις· ὢ τέχνη πνεύματος ὠκυτέρα.<a id="FNanchor_1441"></a><a href="#Footnote_1441" class="fnanchor">1441</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Professor Ernest Gardner translates the two parts of the second
epigram as follows:</p>

<p>“Like as thou wast in life, Ladas, breathing forth thy panting soul,<a id="FNanchor_1442"></a><a href="#Footnote_1442" class="fnanchor">1442</a>
on tip-toe, with every sinew at full strain, such hath Myron wrought
thee in bronze, stamping on thy whole body thy eagerness for the
victor’s crown of Pisa.”</p>

<p>“He is filled with hope, and you may see the breath caught on his
lips from deep within his flanks; surely the bronze will leave its pedestal
and leap to the crown. Such art is swifter than the wind.”<a id="FNanchor_1443"></a><a href="#Footnote_1443" class="fnanchor">1443</a></p>

<p>Even if part of the epigram is rhetorical, we can not doubt that Ladas
was represented in the final spurt just before he arrived at the goal.
His eagerness was not confined to the face—though the panting breath
could have been indicated by half opened lips, but was visible in the
whole body.<a id="FNanchor_1444"></a><a href="#Footnote_1444" class="fnanchor">1444</a> Whereas the girl runner of the Vatican (Pl. <a href="#p2">2</a>) is represented
at the beginning of the race, Myron’s statue represented Ladas
at the end of it. Probably the victor was represented with his weight
thrown on the advanced foot and with the arms close to the sides and
bent at the elbows—a treatment which would have been easy for the
sculptor of the <i>Diskobolos</i>. Mahler tried to identify the statue with
one of the Naples group of so-called runners (Fig. <a href="#f51">51</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1445"></a><a href="#Footnote_1445" class="fnanchor">1445</a> However, as
we shall see, these probably represent wrestlers, and not runners, and
neither of them shows any such tension as we should expect from the
description of the statue of Ladas. Though Foerster believes that the
statue of Ladas stood in Olympia, in honor of his victory in the long
race there,<a id="FNanchor_1446"></a><a href="#Footnote_1446" class="fnanchor">1446</a> we can not say definitely where it was.<a id="FNanchor_1447"></a><a href="#Footnote_1447" class="fnanchor">1447</a></p>

<p>Perhaps our best representation of runners is to be seen in the two
marble statues discovered near Velletri and now in the Palazzo dei
Conservatori, Rome (Figs. 38 and 39).<a id="FNanchor_1448"></a><a href="#Footnote_1448" class="fnanchor">1448</a> The hair and the sharp edges
of the modeling of the flesh, as well as the tree-stumps near the right
legs, show that these statues are copies of bronze originals. They were
at first interpreted as runners, but later were regarded as forming a
group of wrestlers, who were standing opposite one another and holding
their hands out for an opening. However, there is nothing in the pose
or the expression of these statues to show the tension of two opponents.
Moreover, they certainly never formed a group, for stylistic
differences reveal that they are copies of statues by different artists
who lived at different times; one belongs to the severe style of the last
quarter of the fifth century,<a id="FNanchor_1449"></a><a href="#Footnote_1449" class="fnanchor">1449</a> while the other, with its softer forms,
smaller head, and deeper-set eyes, is a product of the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_1450"></a><a href="#Footnote_1450" class="fnanchor">1450</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
The prominent edge of the chest is doubtless meant to indicate the hard
breathing of a runner.<a id="FNanchor_1451"></a><a href="#Footnote_1451" class="fnanchor">1451</a> Just in front of the tree-stump on the older
statue is to be seen a round hole in the plinth, which may have been
made for the end of a club held in the right hand, as such an object is
found in other works of art, notably in a statuette from Palermo, which
is the copy of a fifth-century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> original, and on a second-century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>
grave-stele from Crete.<a id="FNanchor_1452"></a><a href="#Footnote_1452" class="fnanchor">1452</a> Its use, however, is not certainly known.</p>

<p>Furtwaengler, by an ingenious process of reasoning, argued that he
had recovered an actual statue of an Olympic runner in the so-called
<i>Alkibiades</i>, formerly in the Villa Mattei, but now in the Sala della Biga
of the Vatican.<a id="FNanchor_1453"></a><a href="#Footnote_1453" class="fnanchor">1453</a> This torso he ascribed to the sculptor Kresilas, because
of its likeness to the <i>Perikles</i> of that master, which once stood on the
Akropolis,<a id="FNanchor_1454"></a><a href="#Footnote_1454" class="fnanchor">1454</a> and to a marble torso in Naples representing a wounded
man ready to fall, which he thinks is a copy of the <i>Volneratus deficiens</i>
of Kresilas mentioned by Pliny.<a id="FNanchor_1455"></a><a href="#Footnote_1455" class="fnanchor">1455</a> The <i>Alkibiades</i> is very similar to the
Naples gladiator, though later in date; the bearded head, drawn-in
stomach, and muscular chest, and the veins in the upper arm are common
to both. The restorer of the Vatican statue has placed a helmet
under the right foot. But the deep-breathing chest may indicate a
runner, as we saw in the case of the statues of the Conservatori just
discussed. Furtwaengler has the body bend further forward, so that
the right foot may rest upon the ground and the glance be fixed upon
the goal, with the arms extended at the elbows, a position proved for
the right arm, at least, by the <i>puntello</i> above the hip. As the head<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
shows portrait-like features and only those athletes who had won three
victories had portrait statues, he has identified the original of the <i>Alkibiades</i>
with the statue of the famous stade-runner Krison of Himera,
who won his victories at Olympia just after the middle of the fifth
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, the approximate date of the Vatican copy.<a id="FNanchor_1456"></a><a href="#Footnote_1456" class="fnanchor">1456</a> Such an
identification appears, however, to be too far-fetched to be convincing.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Statues of Boy Runners.</span></h4>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 40.</span>—Statue of the <i>Thorn-puller</i> (<i>Spinario</i>).
Palazzo dei Conservatori, Rome.</div>
</div>

<p>Probably the statues of boy runners did not differ essentially from
those of men. That they were sometimes represented in motion is
shown by the footprints on the recovered base of the statue of Sosikrates
by an unknown artist. Here the right foot touched the ground
only with the front portion.<a id="FNanchor_1457"></a><a href="#Footnote_1457" class="fnanchor">1457</a> The view has often been expressed that
the bronze statue in the Palazzo dei Conservatori, Rome, known as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
<i>Spinario</i> (<i>Thorn-puller</i>) portrays a runner (Fig. <a href="#f40">40</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1458"></a><a href="#Footnote_1458" class="fnanchor">1458</a> It represents a boy,
from twelve to fifteen years old, seated upon a rock bending over and
engrossed in extracting a thorn from his left foot, which rests upon the
right knee. The severe hair treatment, low forehead, full cheeks, and
strong chin appear to show the ideal beauty of a boy of the period of
about 460 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> The motive seems to have been inspired directly by
nature—witness the supple bend of the back, the delicate arms, the
naïve, though not too realistic, concentration of interest in the act portrayed.
Few pieces of ancient sculpture have given rise to more discussion
and extraordinary difference of opinion than this popular work.
One school of archæologists<a id="FNanchor_1459"></a><a href="#Footnote_1459" class="fnanchor">1459</a> believes it a late adaptation of a Hellenistic
original, a more accurate copy being the one in the British Museum, and
consequently views it as a purely <i>genre</i> statue impossible of conception
before Alexander’s time. According to this view the London copy was
an archaistic work of the time of Pasiteles. Another school, however,
including Helbig, Wolters, Kekulé, and many others, sees in the Roman
statue an original work of 460 to 450 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, chiefly because the face shows
great similarity to those of the statues of the Olympia gables (especially
to that of Apollo)<a id="FNanchor_1460"></a><a href="#Footnote_1460" class="fnanchor">1460</a>. According to this view the statue can not have
been a <i>genre</i> work, as such works of decorative character were of later
origin, but the motive must be sought in some definite incident—in
some myth or historical event. Thus it has been referred to the colonization
of the Ozolian Lokroi, whose ancestor Lokros is said to have got a
thorn in his foot and to have founded cities near where this occurred in
fulfilment of an oracle. Many others, on the other hand, have seen in
its motive that of a boy victor in running, who has gained his victory
despite a thorn, which he is now pulling out, and who has dedicated his
statue to commemorate both the victory and the untoward circumstances
under which it was won. It has been assigned to various
sculptors and schools—to Myron, Pythagoras, and Kalamis, and to
Peloponnesian, Bœotian, and even Sicilian art.<a id="FNanchor_1461"></a><a href="#Footnote_1461" class="fnanchor">1461</a> The boy’s absorption
in his task certainly reminds us of the concentration so characteristic
of the <i>Diskobolos</i> of Myron. In determining its age and artistic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
affiliations several things must be considered. In the first place, the
Roman statue is a copy, as the rock on which the boy sits is cast with the
figure, which would have been impossible in the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> The
long hair on this copy, which is short on the one in the British Museum,
falls down the neck, but not over the cheeks, as it should on a head
which is thus bent downwards. Pasiteles almost certainly would have
tied it with a ribbon. This shows that the original was the work of an
artist who was used to making standing statues, and was not aware
of the change in the representation of the hair brought about by drooping
ones. Such considerations, in conjunction with the archaic facial
characteristics, almost certainly refer the original work to the fifth century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, a date when <i>genre</i> statues, produced for adornment, did not
exist. Consequently a definite incident must be represented by it,
and it is quite possible that this incident should be sought in athletic
sculpture in the representation of a boy runner.</p>

<p>The <i>Thorn-puller</i> became a model for many imitations from the
beginning of Hellenistic times on. These imitations tended to greater
realism and consequently to the debasement of the original conception,
for they were made to represent peasants, shepherds, satyrs, and
even negroes. The <i>motif</i> was also transferred to figures of girls, as,
<i>e. g.</i>, in the fragment of a terra-cotta statuette found in 1912 at Nida-Haddernheim.<a id="FNanchor_1462"></a><a href="#Footnote_1462" class="fnanchor">1462</a>
In the early Empire it was frequently copied in marble,
and again, during the Renaissance, the motive was used for small
bronzes.<a id="FNanchor_1463"></a><a href="#Footnote_1463" class="fnanchor">1463</a> Of Hellenistic copies, showing how the motive deteriorated,
we shall mention only two: the marble one found on the Esquiline,
in 1874, and known as the Castellani copy, now in the British Museum,<a id="FNanchor_1464"></a><a href="#Footnote_1464" class="fnanchor">1464</a>
the sculptor of which has made it into a truly <i>genre</i> fountain
figure by transforming the noble features of the beautiful Greek runner
into the snub nose and thick lips of a street Arab, and the still later
bronze statuette found near Sparta and now in the Paris collection
of Baron Edmund de Rothschild,<a id="FNanchor_1465"></a><a href="#Footnote_1465" class="fnanchor">1465</a> which represents the boy extracting
the thorn in anger.</p>

<p>Similarly the so-called <i>Sandal-binder</i>—with replicas in Paris (Fig. <a href="#f8">8</a>),
London, Athens, Munich, and elsewhere, has been looked upon, without
decisive grounds, to be sure, as a runner who is tying on his sandals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
after the race.<a id="FNanchor_1466"></a><a href="#Footnote_1466" class="fnanchor">1466</a> We have already discussed this statue in Chapter II,
in connection with the subject of assimilation.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Hoplitodromoi.</span></h4>

<p>The race in armor had a practical value in the training of soldiers,
and so became a popular sport, since it appealed not only to the trained
athlete, but to the citizen in general. It belonged to “mixed athletics,”<a id="FNanchor_1467"></a><a href="#Footnote_1467" class="fnanchor">1467</a>
<i>i. e.</i>, to competitions which were conducted under handicap conditions,
such as our obstacle races, and consequently it never attained the prestige
of the strictly athletic events. It came last among the gymnic
contests at Olympia and elsewhere,<a id="FNanchor_1468"></a><a href="#Footnote_1468" class="fnanchor">1468</a> being followed by the equestrian
events. It seems to have varied in different places in the distance
run, in the armor of the runner, and in the rules which governed the race.
At Olympia, as at Athens, it appears to have been a <i>diaulos</i> or a race of
two stadia.<a id="FNanchor_1469"></a><a href="#Footnote_1469" class="fnanchor">1469</a> The most strenuous race of the sort was run at the
<i>Eleutheria</i> at Platæa, where the contestants were completely enveloped
in armor<a id="FNanchor_1470"></a><a href="#Footnote_1470" class="fnanchor">1470</a> and were subject to peculiar rules. At Olympia the competitors
originally ran with helmets, greaves, and round shields, as
we infer from scenes on archaic vases and from the statement of Pausanias
that the statue of the first victor in this event, Damaretos of
Heraia, was represented with these arms.<a id="FNanchor_1471"></a><a href="#Footnote_1471" class="fnanchor">1471</a> In this passage Pausanias
adds that the Eleans and other Greeks later (ἀνὰ χρόνον) gave up the
greaves, and we find that they disappear on the vase-paintings.<a id="FNanchor_1472"></a><a href="#Footnote_1472" class="fnanchor">1472</a> Hauser
has shown that the vase-paintings, which, however, mostly illustrate
the Athenian practice, display a varied custom in respect of the use
of the greaves before about 520 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, the general use of them until about
450 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, and after that date their disuse.<a id="FNanchor_1473"></a><a href="#Footnote_1473" class="fnanchor">1473</a> The helmet disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
after the greaves, but the shield was never given up.<a id="FNanchor_1474"></a><a href="#Footnote_1474" class="fnanchor">1474</a> Thus the bronze
statue of Mnesiboulos of Elateia, a victor (σὺν τῇ ἀσπίδι) of Pausanias’
day, which stood in “Runner Street” of his native city, appears to have
been represented with the shield.<a id="FNanchor_1475"></a><a href="#Footnote_1475" class="fnanchor">1475</a> It was for this reason that the event
was later sometimes called merely ἀσπίς.<a id="FNanchor_1476"></a><a href="#Footnote_1476" class="fnanchor">1476</a> The shields that appear
on the vases are always round and the helmets are Attic.<a id="FNanchor_1477"></a><a href="#Footnote_1477" class="fnanchor">1477</a> The gradual
reduction in the amount of the armor may have been a concession to
the regular athletes, who probably looked upon the contest as a spurious
sort of athletics. As for the style of the race, the hoplite runners seem
to have run somewhat as the stade and double-course runners, <i>i. e.</i>,
with their right hands up and their arms violently swinging.<a id="FNanchor_1478"></a><a href="#Footnote_1478" class="fnanchor">1478</a></p>

<p>The picturesqueness of such a race appealed especially to vase-painters,
who have given us all the details of the event. The preparations for
the race are seen on a red-figured kylix from Vulci, now in Paris, ascribed
to Euphronios (Panaitios), on which one runner is donning his armor,
while others are practising preliminary runs.<a id="FNanchor_1479"></a><a href="#Footnote_1479" class="fnanchor">1479</a> The start is seen in the
right-hand figure depicted on a r.-f. kylix in Berlin (Fig. <a href="#f41">41</a>, a).<a id="FNanchor_1480"></a><a href="#Footnote_1480" class="fnanchor">1480</a> On
another r.-f. kylix we see a pair of hoplites, one slowing up before reaching
the central post, the other turning it.<a id="FNanchor_1481"></a><a href="#Footnote_1481" class="fnanchor">1481</a> The finish is seen on an
obscene r.-f. kylix from Vulci in the style of Brygos, in the British
Museum, where the bearded winner, with his helmet in his hand, looks
back on his rival, and the latter, apparently in disgust, drops his shield.<a id="FNanchor_1482"></a><a href="#Footnote_1482" class="fnanchor">1482</a>
The most complete illustration of the race is to be seen on the r.-f. Berlin
kylix just mentioned (Fig. <a href="#f41">41</a>, a, b, c.) Here on one side is a group of
three runners; the right-hand one is bending over, ready to start; the one
at the left is about to turn the central post, and the one in the centre,
who is turned in an opposite direction, is on the home stretch; on the
other side of the vase are three runners in full course, while another
appears on the interior of the vase.<a id="FNanchor_1483"></a><a href="#Footnote_1483" class="fnanchor">1483</a> Some vases seem to show that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
the contest often had a semi-comic character, the variations in running
being used to amuse the spectators. Thus the shield might be dropped
and picked up again,<a id="FNanchor_1484"></a><a href="#Footnote_1484" class="fnanchor">1484</a> or it might be held in a peculiar manner.<a id="FNanchor_1485"></a><a href="#Footnote_1485" class="fnanchor">1485</a> This
comic element is brought out in the <i>Aves</i> of Aristophanes, in a scene in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
which Peisthetairos, while observing the chorus of birds advancing with
their crests (λόφωσις), compares them with hoplite runners advancing

in representing the runner in violent
motion, if we may rely on
Pliny’s description of two paintings
of hoplites by Parrhasios.<a id="FNanchor_1487"></a><a href="#Footnote_1487" class="fnanchor">1487</a>
In one of these the runner was
represented as perspiring as he
ran, while in the other
he was represented as
having laid aside his
arms and panting so
realistically that the
observer seemed to
hear him.</p>

<p>We have few representations of hoplitodromes
in sculpture. In the preceding chapter
we discussed the two marble helmeted
heads found at Olympia (Fig. <a href="#f30">30</a>), one of
which shows that the statue of which it was
a part was represented at rest, while the
other, because of the twist in the neck, seems
to have come from a statue which represented
the runner in violent motion. Pausanias saw
on the Athenian Akropolis the statue of the
hoplite runner Epicharinos, the work of the
sculptor Kritios, represented as practising
starts (ὁπλιτοδρομεῖν ἀσκήσαντος).<a id="FNanchor_1488"></a><a href="#Footnote_1488" class="fnanchor">1488</a>
In the well-known Tux bronze in the University
Museum at Tuebingen, we have a statuette
in which the position of the statue of Epicharinos
is probably reproduced. This little
bronze, which is only 0.16 meter tall (Fig. <a href="#f42">42</a>),<a id="FNanchor_1489"></a><a href="#Footnote_1489" class="fnanchor">1489</a> represents a bearded
man, entirely nude, except for the Attic helmet on his head, standing
with feet close together, knees slightly bent, and body inclined forward.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>The right arm is extended, while the left, crooked at the elbow, rests
upon the hip. While Schwabe and Wolters, following the early
theory of Hirt and of the sculptor Dannecker, interpreted the bronze as
the figure of a charioteer, whose left hand was drawn back to hold the
reins and whose right was outstretched in a gesture intended to quiet
the horses, Hauser, de Ridder, Bulle, and many other archæologists
have interpreted it better as a hoplitodrome. The left arm, then,
carried a round shield, such as we have seen on Attic vases. The
next moment the right leg will be advanced, the shield, held back to
get a better start, will be pushed forward, and the runner will race
to the goal in a series of leaps, since the weight of the shield would
prevent him from following the more regular motion of the ordinary
runner. It probably represents, therefore, a hoplite runner, not in
the actual course, as Hauser thought, but practicing a preliminary
start, as de Ridder argued. If the figure represented a charioteer, the
legs would have been set farther apart, in order to give a firmer
position, and it would not be represented as standing on a base, nor
would it be wearing a helmet. The statuette stylistically belongs to
the opening years of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, and may well be a free
imitation of a life-size original of such statues of hoplites as stood in
the Altis at Olympia. Despite the energy depicted in this figure, it
is rash to connect it with the Aeginetan sculptures, as Wolters and
Collignon have done, since a comparison between it and the <i>Champion</i>
of the East gable<a id="FNanchor_1490"></a><a href="#Footnote_1490" class="fnanchor">1490</a> will show great differences. Brunn ascribed the
original to Pythagoras; de Ridder, with reservations, to Kritios and
Nesiotes; while Bulle is more reasonable in referring it to an important
though unnamed artist of the early fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span></p>

<p>Hartwig has published a bronze statuette from Capua,<a id="FNanchor_1491"></a><a href="#Footnote_1491" class="fnanchor">1491</a> now in the
Imperial collection at Vienna, representing a nude youth with a crested
helmet on his head. There is no trace of a shield, but the helmet
and the similarity of the pose to that of the Tuebingen bronze make it
probable that this statuette also represents a hoplitodrome starting.
The so-called <i>Diomedes</i> of Myronian style in the Palazzo Valentini,
Rome,<a id="FNanchor_1492"></a><a href="#Footnote_1492" class="fnanchor">1492</a> whose stooping posture recalls the <i>Diskobolos</i> and accordingly
has been interpreted as one by Matz and von Duhn, more probably
also represents a hoplite-runner, as Furtwaengler maintained, because
of the similarity of its pose to that of the Tux bronze and because
of its helmeted head.<a id="FNanchor_1493"></a><a href="#Footnote_1493" class="fnanchor">1493</a></p>

</div>

<p>Some other attempts to see hoplite runners in existing works of
sculpture have not been so successful. Thus Rayet’s attempt to resuscitate
the old interpretation of Quatremère de Quincy, who had explained
the statue of the so-called <i>Borghese Warrior</i> by Agasias of Ephesos
(Fig. <a href="#f43">43</a>) as that of a hoplitodrome just before reaching the goal, has
been recently revived again by Six.<a id="FNanchor_1494"></a><a href="#Footnote_1494" class="fnanchor">1494</a> This famous marble statue of the
Louvre, belonging to late Greek art, is an example of the last development
in the Argive-Sikyonian school, which for centuries had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
devoted to athletic sculpture.<a id="FNanchor_1495"></a><a href="#Footnote_1495" class="fnanchor">1495</a> Since the statue has no helmet, there
seems to be no valid reason for not adhering to the usual interpretation,
according to which it represents a warrior—by restoring the lost right
arm and hand with a sword—who is defending himself against a foe
above him, conceived of as seated upon a horse. The attitude and the
upward gaze are certainly not those of a runner. Though Collignon,
following Visconti, believes the figure to be one of a group, the man
actually defending himself against a horseman and covering himself
with his shield as he looks up, it is doubtful whether a second figure
ever existed. The artist seems to have contented himself with representing,
not a fight, but only a fighting pose. We are beginning to
understand that the Greek sculptor left something to the imagination
of the beholder.</p>

<p>An attempt has also been made to see a dying hoplite runner in the
Parian marble archaic grave-relief in the National Museum in Athens,
which has already been mentioned as an example of the archaic scheme
of representing running.<a id="FNanchor_1496"></a><a href="#Footnote_1496" class="fnanchor">1496</a> It represents a beardless youth running in
a half-kneeling posture, even though the head is bent and turned in the
opposite direction. The eyes appear to be closed—due, perhaps, to the
faulty sculptor—and the two hands are touching the breast. While no
shield is represented (it is contended that its presence would nearly hide
the figure), still, because of the helmet and the position of the arm, which
latter is obviously that of a long-distance runner, Philios, followed by
Perrot-Chipiez and Bulle, explained it as the representation of a hoplite
runner who is expiring at the end of his course. They date it about 520
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>,<a id="FNanchor_1497"></a><a href="#Footnote_1497" class="fnanchor">1497</a> the date of the introduction of this race at Olympia. However, the
absence of the shield, to say nothing of the greaves, seems an insuperable
objection to such an hypothesis, as the shield was never omitted
in this race, but was invariably its symbol. Svoronos is therefore
more probably right in interpreting the relief as the monument of a
military runner (δρομοκῆρυξ), even if his dating (490–480 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>) is somewhat
too late,<a id="FNanchor_1498"></a><a href="#Footnote_1498" class="fnanchor">1498</a> and if his identifying it with some particular messenger
(such as the Athenian runner Pheidippides, who ran to Sparta for aid
just prior to the battle of Marathon) is fanciful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Pentathletes.</span></h4>

<p>The peculiar features of the pentathlon (πένταθλον) were the three
events, jumping, diskos-throwing, and javelin-throwing. All five events
are summed up in Simonides’ epigram on the pentathlete Diophon,
who won at Delphi and on the Isthmus, the second line of which
runs: ἅλμα, ποδωκείην, δίσκον, ἄκοντα, πάλην.<a id="FNanchor_1499"></a><a href="#Footnote_1499" class="fnanchor">1499</a></p>

<p>The pentathlon did not exist in Homer’s time. Pindar expressly says
that it did not exist in heroic days, but that then a separate prize was
given for each feat.<a id="FNanchor_1500"></a><a href="#Footnote_1500" class="fnanchor">1500</a> At the games on Scheria, King Alkinoos boasts to
Odysseus of the superiority of his countrymen in πύξ τε παλαισμοσύνῃ τε
καὶ ἅλμασιν ἠδὲ πόδεσσιν.<a id="FNanchor_1501"></a><a href="#Footnote_1501" class="fnanchor">1501</a> The pentathlon for men was introduced at
Olympia at the same time as wrestling toward the end of the eighth century,
in Ol. 18 (&#8239;=&#8239;708 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>),<a id="FNanchor_1502"></a><a href="#Footnote_1502" class="fnanchor">1502</a> and the pentathlon for boys eighty years
later, in Ol. 38 (&#8239;=&#8239;628 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), only to be stopped soon after.<a id="FNanchor_1503"></a><a href="#Footnote_1503" class="fnanchor">1503</a> Pausanias
mentions fifteen victors at Olympia, who had statues erected in their
honor, for seventeen victories in the pentathlon, thus giving the pentathletes
sixth rank there in point of number.</p>

<p>The b.-f. Bacchic amphora in Rome already discussed represents
four events out of the five: running, leaping, diskos-throwing, and
akontion-throwing (Figs. 36 A and 36 B).<a id="FNanchor_1504"></a><a href="#Footnote_1504" class="fnanchor">1504</a> On several Panathenaic
vases we find one or more events, and the three characteristic ones on
several, one of which we here reproduce (Fig. <a href="#f44">44</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1505"></a><a href="#Footnote_1505" class="fnanchor">1505</a></p>

<p>The various events are common on r.-f. vases,<a id="FNanchor_1506"></a><a href="#Footnote_1506" class="fnanchor">1506</a> though these may
not represent the pentathlon contests, but merely gymnasium scenes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
showing that such contests were important. We have already said
that the pentathlon represented the whole physical training of Greek
youths; consequently the pentathlete was looked upon as the typical
athlete, being superior to all others in all-round development, even if
surpassed by them in certain special events. It was for this reason that
Polykleitos, in order to embody the principles of his athlete canon,
made a statue of a javelin-thrower (the <i>Doryphoros</i>) as the best
example of an all-round man.</p>

British Museum, London.</div>
</div>

<p>None of the statues of pentathletes at Olympia has been recovered
with certainty in Roman copies. That some of them were represented
at rest is shown by the base of the statue of the victor Pythokles of
Elis, by the elder Polykleitos, which has been recovered.<a id="FNanchor_1507"></a><a href="#Footnote_1507" class="fnanchor">1507</a> This base
supported two different statues in succession. The feet of the earlier
one by Polykleitos were riveted into circular holes, and behind the right
foot on the upper surface of the base was inscribed the artist’s name,
while the victor’s appeared on the vertical front. This statue was later
removed and was replaced by another, whose pose was different, as we
see from the footmarks, which show that the feet were attached with
lead in hollows. Probably the old inscription was renewed in archaic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
letters when this second statue was set up, the older letters being retained,
perhaps, to conceal the theft. The original statue was removed
by the first century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, or perhaps under Nero;<a id="FNanchor_1508"></a><a href="#Footnote_1508" class="fnanchor">1508</a> the new one was also
inscribed as the work of Polykleitos. A base of the Hadrianic or
Antonine age has been found in Rome, inscribed with the names Polykleitos
and Pythokles.<a id="FNanchor_1509"></a><a href="#Footnote_1509" class="fnanchor">1509</a> Since the footmarks do not agree with those
of either one of the Olympia statues, Petersen believes that the existing
footmarks are due to an older use of the base and that they have
nothing to do with the statue of Pythokles. Perhaps the statue on the
Roman base was the original one by Polykleitos removed from Olympia
to Rome, though it is possible that it was only a copy, the original
being elsewhere in Rome. While the later statue at Olympia had the
feet squarely on the ground, the original one stood on the right foot,
the left being drawn back and turned out, touching the ground only
with the ball. Hence the left knee must have turned outwards, a
natural position, if the head of the statue was turned slightly to the left.
In other words, this is the usual Polykleitan scheme. Furtwaengler
has made a strong though hardly convincing attempt to identify this
original statue with a copy surviving in two replicas at Rome and
Munich, which, as he believes, fit the conditions of the statue of
Pythokles.<a id="FNanchor_1510"></a><a href="#Footnote_1510" class="fnanchor">1510</a> These copies represent a nude youth standing with the
weight of the body on the right leg, the left drawn back and outwards.
The head is turned to the left, the right arm is held close to
the side (the hand, perhaps, once holding a fillet), and the left forearm
is outstretched from the elbow and holds an aryballos in the hand.
The two works are manifestly Polykleitan in style—the body, head,
and hair treatment resembling that of the <i>Doryphoros</i>. He assumed
that the feet corresponded in scale with the footmarks on the Olympia
base.</p>

<p>Helbig, in the first edition of his <i>Fuehrer</i>, recognized the kinship between
the Vatican statuette and the <i>Doryphoros</i> of Polykleitos, and was
prone to accept Furtwaengler’s identification; but later on, in the third
edition, he ascribed the statuette only to the Polykleitan circle and
denied that its foot position corresponded with that of the Pythokles
base. Amelung also, while accepting its Polykleitan character, has
shown that the feet of the statuette are closer together than those on
the Olympia base and are placed at a slightly different angle. As for
the Munich statue, both Helbig and Amelung have ruled it out of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
evidence. The head, though similar to that of the statuette, also
discloses marked differences, and the legs of the two works do not
have the same pose. Loewy agrees with Amelung that the statue
of Pythokles conformed with the type of the <i>Diadoumenos</i>—especially

with the Vaison copy (see Fig. <a href="#f28">28</a>)—and
with that of the <i>Doryphoros</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1511"></a><a href="#Footnote_1511" class="fnanchor">1511</a> We
can not, therefore, safely assume that the
statue of Pythokles has been recovered in
any existing copy.<a id="FNanchor_1512"></a><a href="#Footnote_1512" class="fnanchor">1512</a> A further variant of
the works just discussed should be mentioned
here—the beautiful marble statue
of a boy victor in Dresden, known as the
<i>Dresden Boy</i> (Fig. <a href="#f45">45</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1513"></a><a href="#Footnote_1513" class="fnanchor">1513</a> In this statue the
leg position is nearly like that indicated
by the marks on the Pythokles basis,
though the left foot is not set so far back
nor its tip so far out. The head is turned
to the left and slightly lowered, the right
arm hung to the side, and the left forearm
was outstretched, the hand doubtless
holding some athletic article, at which the
boy is looking down, perhaps a diskos<a id="FNanchor_1514"></a><a href="#Footnote_1514" class="fnanchor">1514</a> or
a fillet. This beautiful athlete statue has
many stylistic points in common with the
<i>Diadoumenos</i>, and shows similar Attic influence,
and its original may be referred
with Furtwaengler to the later period of
the master himself. It gives us an excellent
idea how Polykleitos may have made
his Olympia boy victors appear. A more
remote variant seems to be furnished by
a fourth-century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> bronze statuette of a
youthful athlete in the Louvre.<a id="FNanchor_1515"></a><a href="#Footnote_1515" class="fnanchor">1515</a> Here the position of the feet, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
turn of the head, and the direction of the gaze are the same as in
the <i>Dresden Boy</i>. However, as the right arm is raised horizontally,
Furtwaengler believed that the right hand held a fillet which the
youth is letting fall into the palm of the left.</p>

<p>That statues of pentathletes at Olympia were also represented in
motion is shown by the footmarks on the recovered base of one of the
two statues mentioned by Pausanias as set up in honor of the Elean
Aischines, who won two victories some time between Ols. 126 and 132
(&#8239;=&#8239;276 and 252 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_1516"></a><a href="#Footnote_1516" class="fnanchor">1516</a>
These marks show that the statue represented the
victor in violent movement, since the left foot was turned outwards and
the right one was brought almost to the edge of the base.</p>

<p>We shall next consider in some detail how the pentathlete may have
been represented at Olympia in the three characteristic contests of
jumping, diskos-throwing, and javelin-throwing. We have already discussed
the runner, and in a future section we shall discuss the wrestler,
both of whom contended in these events not only in the pentathlon,
but also in the corresponding independent competitions.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Jumpers.</span></h4>

<p>Jumping was a well-known contest in heroic days. In Homer, however,
it did not take place at the games of Patroklos, but only at those
held by King Alkinoos.<a id="FNanchor_1517"></a><a href="#Footnote_1517" class="fnanchor">1517</a> Quintus Smyrnæus has the Trojan heroes
contend in jumping,<a id="FNanchor_1518"></a><a href="#Footnote_1518" class="fnanchor">1518</a> and the contest goes back to mythology.<a id="FNanchor_1519"></a><a href="#Footnote_1519" class="fnanchor">1519</a> Though
Plato does not mention it, Aristotle does.<a id="FNanchor_1520"></a><a href="#Footnote_1520" class="fnanchor">1520</a> Later it became an essential
part of the pentathlon, though never an independent contest at
the great games. It was probably considered to be the most representative
feature of the pentathlon, perhaps because of the customary use
of the <i>halteres</i> in the physical exercises of the gymnasium. Jumping-weights
were, in fact, the special symbol of the pentathlon, and, as we
saw in the preceding chapter, were often the definitive attributes
indicated on statues of pentathletes.<a id="FNanchor_1521"></a><a href="#Footnote_1521" class="fnanchor">1521</a> We shall next discuss the
appearance and use of such jumping-weights. Their form is often a
sure indication of the date of a statue.</p>

<p>Juethner has made a careful study of the different shapes of <i>halteres</i>
and his conclusions have been followed, for the most part, by Gardiner.<a id="FNanchor_1522"></a><a href="#Footnote_1522" class="fnanchor">1522</a>
The <i>halteres</i> do not appear in Homer, but were in existence at least by
the beginning of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, and a little later they probably
appeared on pentathlete statues. To this period belongs the lead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
weight from Eleusis now in Athens, whose inscription records that it was
dedicated by one Epainetos to commemorate his victory in jumping.<a id="FNanchor_1523"></a><a href="#Footnote_1523" class="fnanchor">1523</a>
On vase-paintings of the sixth and fifth centuries <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, we see numerous
types, but two main ones. Early b.-f. vases show a semicircular piece
of metal or stone with a deep depression on one side for a finger grip,
the two club-like ends being equal (as in Figs. 36A and 44). In the
early fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, a club-like type came in, which shows many
modifications in the size and shape of the ends.<a id="FNanchor_1524"></a><a href="#Footnote_1524" class="fnanchor">1524</a> In the fifth century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, the second main type appeared, of an elongated semispherical
form, thickest in the middle and with the ends pointed or rounded.
These correspond with the “archaic” ones, which Pausanias saw on the
figure of <i>Agon</i> in the dedicatory group of Mikythos at Olympia<a id="FNanchor_1525"></a><a href="#Footnote_1525" class="fnanchor">1525</a> and
describes as forming half an elongated circle and so fastened as to let
the fingers pass through. We have two stone examples of this type:
one found at Corinth, now in the Polytechnic Institute in Athens,<a id="FNanchor_1526"></a><a href="#Footnote_1526" class="fnanchor">1526</a> in
which a hole is cut behind the middle for the fingers and thumbs, and
a more primitive single one from Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_1527"></a><a href="#Footnote_1527" class="fnanchor">1527</a> Philostratos divides the
Greek jumping-weights into “long” and “spherical,”<a id="FNanchor_1528"></a><a href="#Footnote_1528" class="fnanchor">1528</a> which Juethner
identifies with the two types just discussed. Gardiner, however, finds
this impossible, since Pausanias speaks of one type as “archaic,” and he
consequently thinks that these were no longer in use in the time of Philostratos.
After the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> we have little evidence about
<i>halteres</i> until Roman days, when a cylindrical type appears on Roman
copies of Greek statues of athletes, on mosaics and wall-paintings.<a id="FNanchor_1529"></a><a href="#Footnote_1529" class="fnanchor">1529</a>
Thus it appears on the tree-trunk in two athlete statues in Dresden<a id="FNanchor_1530"></a><a href="#Footnote_1530" class="fnanchor">1530</a> and
the Pitti Gallery in Florence,<a id="FNanchor_1531"></a><a href="#Footnote_1531" class="fnanchor">1531</a> and on the Lateran athlete mosaic from
Tusculum of the imperial period.<a id="FNanchor_1532"></a><a href="#Footnote_1532" class="fnanchor">1532</a> In Roman days jumping-weights
were used for the most part in medical gymnastics, like our dumb-bells.<a id="FNanchor_1533"></a><a href="#Footnote_1533" class="fnanchor">1533</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<p>Philostratos says that the jump was the most difficult part of the
pentathlon.<a id="FNanchor_1534"></a><a href="#Footnote_1534" class="fnanchor">1534</a> It never existed as an independent competition despite its
popularity in Greece. This popularity is attested by the frequency
with which it is depicted on vases from the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> onward.
Here the jumper is regularly shown with weights, and we can assume that
many pentathlete statues were so represented, the sculptor ordinarily
copying the kind of weight which was in use in his own age. While
Philostratos in his day thought that the use of weights was merely to aid
in exercise, Aristotle long before had rightly understood that the
jumper could make a longer jump with than without them,<a id="FNanchor_1535"></a><a href="#Footnote_1535" class="fnanchor">1535</a> a fact
easily proved by the feats of modern jumpers. While the modern
record for the running broad jump is 25 feet 3 inches,<a id="FNanchor_1536"></a><a href="#Footnote_1536" class="fnanchor">1536</a> an English
athlete jumped 29 feet 7 inches with the use of 5-pound weights,<a id="FNanchor_1537"></a><a href="#Footnote_1537" class="fnanchor">1537</a>
and a German officer in full uniform jumped 23 feet from a springboard.<a id="FNanchor_1538"></a><a href="#Footnote_1538" class="fnanchor">1538</a>
The recorded jumps of Phaÿllos at Delphi and of Chionis at
Olympia, the former 55 feet and the latter 52, can not, however, be
explained as ordinary broad jumps, even if we assume that the Greek
jumper was far superior to the modern one. Such jumps would be impossible
even with springboards or raised platforms, and we have no
evidence that the Greeks used such devices. We might explain them
on the theory of triple jumps<a id="FNanchor_1539"></a><a href="#Footnote_1539" class="fnanchor">1539</a>—though the difficulty of such a solution
is very great—or simply as mistakes in the records. Thus the record of
Phaÿllos is found in a late epigram, in which this athlete is also said
to have thrown the diskos 105 feet.<a id="FNanchor_1540"></a><a href="#Footnote_1540" class="fnanchor">1540</a> That of Chionis is, to be sure,
given by Africanus.<a id="FNanchor_1541"></a><a href="#Footnote_1541" class="fnanchor">1541</a> But it is more than probable that νβʹ (52) of his
record should read κβʹ (22), since the Armenian Latin text reads <i>duos
et viginti cubitus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1542"></a><a href="#Footnote_1542" class="fnanchor">1542</a></p>

<p>Vase-paintings tell us how the <i>halteres</i> were used.<a id="FNanchor_1543"></a><a href="#Footnote_1543" class="fnanchor">1543</a> The jumper
swung them forward and upward until they were level with or higher
than the head; then he brought them down, bending the body forward
until the hands were below the knees, the jump taking place on
the return swing. We find the preliminary swing represented most
commonly on the vases;<a id="FNanchor_1544"></a><a href="#Footnote_1544" class="fnanchor">1544</a> we also see on them the top of the upward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
swing,<a id="FNanchor_1545"></a><a href="#Footnote_1545" class="fnanchor">1545</a> the bottom of the downward swing,<a id="FNanchor_1546"></a><a href="#Footnote_1546" class="fnanchor">1546</a> the jumper in midair,<a id="FNanchor_1547"></a><a href="#Footnote_1547" class="fnanchor">1547</a>
and the moment just before alighting.<a id="FNanchor_1548"></a><a href="#Footnote_1548" class="fnanchor">1548</a> The act of landing is seen
on an Etruscan wall-painting from a tomb at Chiusi.<a id="FNanchor_1549"></a><a href="#Footnote_1549" class="fnanchor">1549</a> Running
jumps are the ones most commonly depicted.<a id="FNanchor_1550"></a><a href="#Footnote_1550" class="fnanchor">1550</a></p>

<p>The representation of the jump, therefore, was specially adapted to
the vase-painter and not to the sculptor. If any movement in the
jump could have been represented to advantage in sculpture, it would
have been the early position in which the weights were swung forward
and upwards. This is the one represented on an incised bronze diskos
from Sicily now in the British Museum,<a id="FNanchor_1551"></a><a href="#Footnote_1551" class="fnanchor">1551</a> where an athlete, with his right
leg drawn back for the spring, is holding the weights in his outstretched
hands. A small finely modelled bronze statuette dating from the middle
of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, in the Metropolitan Museum, New York,
may represent a jumper either just taking off, or perhaps just finishing
the jump.<a id="FNanchor_1552"></a><a href="#Footnote_1552" class="fnanchor">1552</a> The athlete is standing with his left foot advanced, his
knees bent back, and his body leaning forward, and is holding both arms
in front, the palms downwards. Such a concentrated attitude reminds
us strongly of Myron, under whose influence this statuette must have
been made. Some have interpreted it as the representation of a diver,
though the hands seem to be held too far apart and the body wrongly
poised for that position, as we see it in a statuette of a diver from Perugia.<a id="FNanchor_1553"></a><a href="#Footnote_1553" class="fnanchor">1553</a>
More likely a jumper is intended, as the attitude is very similar
to that depicted on several vases.<a id="FNanchor_1554"></a><a href="#Footnote_1554" class="fnanchor">1554</a> However, as the jumper has no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
<i>halteres</i>, it can not represent a pentathlete, but must be an ordinary
gymnasium athlete.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Diskoboloi.</span></h4>

<p>The diskos-throw (δισκοβολία) goes back to mythology and heroic
days.<a id="FNanchor_1555"></a><a href="#Footnote_1555" class="fnanchor">1555</a> In Homer, at the games of Patroklos, Achilles casts a metal
mass called the σόλος.<a id="FNanchor_1556"></a><a href="#Footnote_1556" class="fnanchor">1556</a> This was the primitive type of diskos. Of
such early contests and feats of strength we have a good record in the
red-sandstone mass, weighing 143.5 kilograms (&#8239;=&#8239;315 pounds), which has
been found at Olympia, marked with a sixth-century inscription to the
effect that one Bybon threw it over his head.<a id="FNanchor_1557"></a><a href="#Footnote_1557" class="fnanchor">1557</a> There is nothing athletic,
however, about the use of such a stone or of the Homeric <i>solos</i>.
The diskos was also known to Homer.<a id="FNanchor_1558"></a><a href="#Footnote_1558" class="fnanchor">1558</a> It was of stone, and in Pindar
the heroes Nikeus, Kastor, and Iolaos still hurl the stone diskos instead
of the metal one of the poet’s day.<a id="FNanchor_1559"></a><a href="#Footnote_1559" class="fnanchor">1559</a> The stone diskos appears on sixth-century
vases as a white object,<a id="FNanchor_1560"></a><a href="#Footnote_1560" class="fnanchor">1560</a> but metal ones were introduced at
the end of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> A bronze one from Kephallenia (?) in
the British Museum has a sixth-century inscription in the Doric dialect
and in the alphabet of the Ionian Islands, which gives the dedication
of Exoïdas to the Dioskouroi.<a id="FNanchor_1561"></a><a href="#Footnote_1561" class="fnanchor">1561</a> Several others have been found in
different parts of Greece, especially at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_1562"></a><a href="#Footnote_1562" class="fnanchor">1562</a> Pausanias says
that boys used a lighter diskos than men.<a id="FNanchor_1563"></a><a href="#Footnote_1563" class="fnanchor">1563</a></p>

<p>While only unimportant monuments outside of vase-paintings illustrate
the jump, those illustrating the diskos-throw are rich and varied,
including not only vases, but statues, statuettes, small bronzes, reliefs,
coins, and gems.<a id="FNanchor_1564"></a><a href="#Footnote_1564" class="fnanchor">1564</a></p>

<p>In his careful attempt at reconstructing the method of casting the
diskos, E. N. Gardiner has distinguished seven different positions,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
which are illustrated by the monuments.<a id="FNanchor_1565"></a><a href="#Footnote_1565" class="fnanchor">1565</a> He shows that while the
swing of the quoit was always the same, <i>i. e.</i>, in a vertical and not
in a horizontal arc, and the throw was invariably made from a
position like that of Myron’s statue, the preliminary and certain
other movements varied. It will be well, before discussing representations
of the diskos-thrower in sculpture, very briefly to recapitulate
his summary of positions, using the evidence which he and
others have collected. First, the preliminary position or stance,
with three variations: either the position of the <i>Standing Diskobolos</i>
of the Vatican (Pl. <a href="#p6">6</a>), which occurs in bronzes, but not on vases;
or the position in which the diskobolos raises the quoit with the left
hand level with the shoulder, which occurs on vase-paintings;<a id="FNanchor_1566"></a><a href="#Footnote_1566" class="fnanchor">1566</a> or that
in which the diskos is held outwards in both hands level with the waist.<a id="FNanchor_1567"></a><a href="#Footnote_1567" class="fnanchor">1567</a>
From any of these stance positions, either with or without change
of feet, we reach the second position, in which the diskos is raised in
both hands and extended either horizontally to the front and level
with the head,<a id="FNanchor_1568"></a><a href="#Footnote_1568" class="fnanchor">1568</a> or held above the head.<a id="FNanchor_1569"></a><a href="#Footnote_1569" class="fnanchor">1569</a> Thirdly the diskos is swung
downwards and rests upon the right forearm, with either foot forward.<a id="FNanchor_1570"></a><a href="#Footnote_1570" class="fnanchor">1570</a>
This position leads up to that of Myron’s statue, in which the diskos is
swung as far back as possible (Pls. 22, 23, and Figs. 34, 35).<a id="FNanchor_1571"></a><a href="#Footnote_1571" class="fnanchor">1571</a> The fifth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
position is the beginning of the forward swing, when the body is straightened.<a id="FNanchor_1572"></a><a href="#Footnote_1572" class="fnanchor">1572</a>
As the diskos swings downwards and the left foot advances,
the sixth position is reached.<a id="FNanchor_1573"></a><a href="#Footnote_1573" class="fnanchor">1573</a> Lastly the right foot is advanced after
the diskos is cast.<a id="FNanchor_1574"></a><a href="#Footnote_1574" class="fnanchor">1574</a></p>

<p>A victor statue of a diskobolos
might conceivably have taken
<span class="figright250"><a id="f46"></a>
<img src="images/i_p220.jpg" width="250" height="445" alt="Bronze Statuette of a Diskobolos." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 46.</span>—Bronze Statuette of a <i>Diskobolos</i>.
Metropolitan Museum, New York.</span></span>
any one of these seven positions.
We have already considered the
two statues, the <i>Standing Diskobolos</i>
of Naukydes in the Vatican
(Pl. <a href="#p6">6</a>) and that of Myron
(Pls. 22, 23, and Figs. 34, 35),
the two most important works
in sculpture to illustrate positions
of the throw. The statue
of Naukydes is not taking aim,
as Juethner maintains, nor looking
down the course. The head
is inclined a little to the right and
downwards, and the eyes are directed
to the ground only a short
distance away, thus measuring
the distance the left foot is to
be advanced, when the diskos
is finally swung forward for the
cast, which takes place off the
left and not off the right foot.
The right forearm is rightly
restored, as it thus appears
on bronzes which imitate this
stance.<a id="FNanchor_1575"></a><a href="#Footnote_1575" class="fnanchor">1575</a>
A different stance is
shown in a fine bronze statuette
in the Metropolitan Museum
(Fig. <a href="#f46">46</a>),<a id="FNanchor_1576"></a><a href="#Footnote_1576" class="fnanchor">1576</a> dating from about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
480 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> This little masterpiece of the transition period of Attic
art, still disclosing archaic traits, represents a diskobolos standing
firmly on both legs, the right being slightly advanced, and holding
with the left hand the diskos level with the head. That he is preparing
for intense action is seen by the way in which the toes catch
the ground. Though the right arm is broken off from below the
shoulder, we can infer from vase-paintings which show diskoboloi in
the same position<a id="FNanchor_1577"></a><a href="#Footnote_1577" class="fnanchor">1577</a> that it was lowered and bent at the elbow and
the hand left open. From this position the diskos will be raised
high above the head with both hands, as in a bronze in Athens,<a id="FNanchor_1578"></a><a href="#Footnote_1578" class="fnanchor">1578</a>
which illustrates Gardiner’s second position.</p>

<p>The movement is carried a little further—showing the moment
of transition to the downward swing or third position—in a fifth-century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> bronze in the British Museum.<a id="FNanchor_1579"></a><a href="#Footnote_1579" class="fnanchor">1579</a> Here a nude, beardless
athlete is represented standing with the right foot advanced and holding
the diskos in both hands before him above the head. The right hand
grasps the quoit underneath and the left at the top.<a id="FNanchor_1580"></a><a href="#Footnote_1580" class="fnanchor">1580</a> The third position
is well illustrated by the tiny archaic bronze on the cover of a lebes
in the British Museum,<a id="FNanchor_1581"></a><a href="#Footnote_1581" class="fnanchor">1581</a> which represents a nude and beardless youth
standing with the left foot advanced and with the left hand raised,
while the right holds the diskos. Almost the same pose is also seen in
a small bronze in the Antiquarium, Berlin.<a id="FNanchor_1582"></a><a href="#Footnote_1582" class="fnanchor">1582</a></p>

<p>Two archaic statuettes from the Akropolis, now in the National
Museum in Athens, and recently published, should be mentioned in this
connection.<a id="FNanchor_1583"></a><a href="#Footnote_1583" class="fnanchor">1583</a> The more archaic of these represents a youth in an attitude
which has been misunderstood. De Ridder interpreted it as a
dancing man, while Staïs thought it represented a youth walking along
with his left hand raised as if to ward off a blow. White, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
showed that it (like another less perfect example from the Akropolis,
no. 6594) represents a diskobolos standing with the right foot advanced
and holding the diskos in front of the body with the right hand, resting
it against the flat of the forearm, while the left arm is raised above the
head. Thus it is another example illustrating the initial stage of Gardiner’s
third position. The other statuette, wrongly mounted, should,
according to White, be made to lean further forward; the knees are
bent, the body swung forward from the hips, the head thrown back and
upward, the right arm stretched forth with the flat of the forearm uppermost
and the left similarly placed. Gardiner and Staïs interpreted this
figure as a charioteer, and de Ridder as either a jumper, who has raised
his <i>halteres</i> preparatory to the leap, or a diskobolos. White has shown
that the position of the right arm proves it to be a diskobolos, represented
in a movement between Gardiner’s third and fourth positions, just prior
to that of Myron’s statue. De Ridder believed both statues to be Aeginetan,
but no. 6614, when compared with Myron’s statue, is certainly Attic,
and resemblances in the treatment of the hair, eyes, and mouth show
that both statuettes are of the same school. It has often been said that
Myron’s great statue had no predecessor, as it certainly had no successor.
Its fame was enhanced by the assumption that Myron passed at
one stride from such statues as the <i>Tyrannicides</i> to that complex work.
Such works, however, as these statuettes—especially no. 6614—show
that the preliminary problems had been solved on a humble scale before
Myron undertook his consummate work. Here, then, we have works by
artists who belonged to the very movement which produced Myron.</p>

<p>For the last three positions analyzed by Gardiner (nos. 5, 6, 7) our
only illustrations appear to be vase-paintings.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Akontistai.</span></h4>

<p>Javelin-throwing (ἀκοντίζειν, ἀκοντισμός) was very old and was universal
in Greece, its origin being traced back to mythology.<a id="FNanchor_1584"></a><a href="#Footnote_1584" class="fnanchor">1584</a> Stassoff
tried to trace it to Oriental sources,<a id="FNanchor_1585"></a><a href="#Footnote_1585" class="fnanchor">1585</a> but inasmuch as no such contest
is shown on the monuments of Egypt or Assyria, Juethner is probably
right in assuming that it was Greek in origin. In Homer it was a separate
contest at the games of Patroklos.<a id="FNanchor_1586"></a><a href="#Footnote_1586" class="fnanchor">1586</a> Juethner has distinguished
two types of javelin-throwing in the historical period: one in which the
spear or akontion was pointed more or less upwards,<a id="FNanchor_1587"></a><a href="#Footnote_1587" class="fnanchor">1587</a> the other in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
it was held horizontally.<a id="FNanchor_1588"></a><a href="#Footnote_1588" class="fnanchor">1588</a> Only the former type is represented in
illustrations of purely athletic competitions, the latter type referring to
illustrations of the practical use of javelin-throwing, <i>i. e.</i>, in war or
in the chase. Vase-paintings of palæstra scenes almost invariably
show javelins with blunt points; the throwers’ heads are frequently
turned back before the throw, and there is no sign of any target. On
vase-paintings, however, which represent practical javelin-throwing
from horseback, the javelins are pointed. This proves that in athletic
contests the throw was for distance and not at a mark.<a id="FNanchor_1589"></a><a href="#Footnote_1589" class="fnanchor">1589</a> The javelin
used in Greek games had several names, ἄκων, ἀκόντιον, etc.<a id="FNanchor_1590"></a><a href="#Footnote_1590" class="fnanchor">1590</a> It was
about the height of a man, as we know from its appearance on a Spartan
relief,<a id="FNanchor_1591"></a><a href="#Footnote_1591" class="fnanchor">1591</a> and from many vase-paintings representing palæstra scenes
(Fig. <a href="#f44">44</a>). It was thrown by means of a thong (ἀγκύλη, Lat. <i>amentum</i>),
which was fastened near the centre and consisted of a detachable
leathern strip from 12 to 18 inches long. This was bound tight, with
a loop left, into which the thrower inserted his first and middle fingers.<a id="FNanchor_1592"></a><a href="#Footnote_1592" class="fnanchor">1592</a>
The method of casting is seen on many vases.<a id="FNanchor_1593"></a><a href="#Footnote_1593" class="fnanchor">1593</a> Gardiner has analyzed
three different positions from vase-paintings. Usually the throw was
made with a short run, though standing throws are also pictured.<a id="FNanchor_1594"></a><a href="#Footnote_1594" class="fnanchor">1594</a>
First the thrower extends the right arm back to its full length and, with
the left hand opposite the right breast, holds the end of the spear and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
pushes it back, holding it downwards or horizontally.<a id="FNanchor_1595"></a><a href="#Footnote_1595" class="fnanchor">1595</a> Next he starts
to run, turning his body sidewise and extending his left arm to the
front. On a r.-f. Munich kylix<a id="FNanchor_1596"></a><a href="#Footnote_1596" class="fnanchor">1596</a> we see the first and second positions.
The youth on the left is steadying the javelin with the left hand, while
the one on the right has just let it go. A further turn of the body to
the right takes place and the right knee is bent, while the right shoulder
is dropped and the hand is turned outwards.<a id="FNanchor_1597"></a><a href="#Footnote_1597" class="fnanchor">1597</a> The actual cast is very
uncommon on vase-paintings, because of difficulty in representing it.<a id="FNanchor_1598"></a><a href="#Footnote_1598" class="fnanchor">1598</a></p>

<p>Because of the assumed lack of sculptural monuments, Reisch<a id="FNanchor_1599"></a><a href="#Footnote_1599" class="fnanchor">1599</a> and

others have wrongly doubted
whether javelin-throwers were
represented in sculpture as victors.
There certainly is no a priori reason
why athletic sculptors might not
have made statues in any one of
the three poses which Gardiner
has distinguished on vase-paintings,
even if this contest, like
jumping, was better adapted to
the painter than to the sculptor.
Furthermore, we shall attempt to
show that such monuments actually
did exist.</p>

<p>The best example of such a javelin-thrower
seems to be the <i>Doryphoros</i>,
the most famous statue of
Polykleitos, in which he illustrated
his canon of athletic forms. The
<i>Doryphoros</i> exists in many copies,
all of which agree fairly well in
style and proportions. K. Friedrichs,
in his monograph <i>Der Doryphoros des Polyklets</i>, which appeared
in 1863,<a id="FNanchor_1600"></a><a href="#Footnote_1600" class="fnanchor">1600</a>
was the first to show that the statue found in 1797 in the
Palaistra at Pompeii, and now in the Naples Museum (Pl. <a href="#p4">4</a>), was
a copy of the original bronze, as it shows all the peculiarities of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
master’s style known to us from tradition.<a id="FNanchor_1601"></a><a href="#Footnote_1601" class="fnanchor">1601</a> Mahler enumerates
7 statues, 17 torsos, and 36 heads copied from the original, and the fine,
but expressionless, Augustan bronze bust from the villa of the Pisos,
Herculaneum, inscribed as the work of the sculptor Apollonios, son
of Archios, of Athens, which is now in Naples (Fig. <a href="#f47">47</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1602"></a><a href="#Footnote_1602" class="fnanchor">1602</a> The best-preserved

copy of the statue, the one in
Naples, is surpassed in workmanship by
the green basalt torso in the Uffizi Gallery
in Florence<a id="FNanchor_1603"></a><a href="#Footnote_1603" class="fnanchor">1603</a> and by the marble one
formerly in the possession of Count Pourtalès
in Berlin.<a id="FNanchor_1604"></a><a href="#Footnote_1604" class="fnanchor">1604</a> A poorer copy is to be
found in the Braccio Nuovo of the Vatican
(Fig. <a href="#f48">48</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1605"></a><a href="#Footnote_1605" class="fnanchor">1605</a> In these copies we see a
thick-set youth standing with the weight
of the body on the right leg, the left one
thrown back and touching the ground
only with the toes, seemingly ready to
advance, though the shoulders do not
partake of the walking action. He is
represented, therefore, at the moment
of transition from walking to a rest
position—in other words in a purely
theoretical pose—at rest, indeed, but
just ready again to advance.<a id="FNanchor_1606"></a><a href="#Footnote_1606" class="fnanchor">1606</a> His left
hand held a short <i>akontion</i> over the
shoulder and not the long spear (δόρυ),
whence the name <i>Doryphoros</i> or spear-bearer
is derived.<a id="FNanchor_1607"></a><a href="#Footnote_1607" class="fnanchor">1607</a> The head is turned
to the same side as the advanced foot,
which perhaps is an example of the
monotony in the work of the master
complained of by ancient critics; variety
would have been attained by turning it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
in the opposite direction. In the carefully worked bronze original, which,
however, must have had an insignificant intellectual aspect, the apparently
simple problem—hitherto vainly attempted in Greek art—of representing
a man standing almost motionless, but full of life, was for the
first time solved. It is a long way from the motionless figures known
as “Apollos,” with their arms glued to the sides and their legs close
together, to this vigorous athlete. As we have already indicated,
Greek art developed the first step beyond the “Apollos” by further
advancing one leg of a statue and, it may be, extending one forearm
horizontally. The next step was to place one foot slightly sidewise
and thus relieve it of the weight of the body—the well-known scheme
of the “free” and “rest” leg. At first the relaxation was slight, the
“free” leg not being intended to move forward, nor the parts of the body
to be much shifted. Polykleitos’ innovation consisted in having the
legs so placed, one behind the other, that the figure, while apparently
resting on one,<a id="FNanchor_1608"></a><a href="#Footnote_1608" class="fnanchor">1608</a> seemed to be advancing. On the ground of the
familiar passage in Pliny cited, it has been generally assumed that Polykleitos
introduced the walking motive into sculpture. However, this
motive was probably the invention of the earlier Argive school, borrowed
by Polykleitos for his canon, as seen in the statue of the so-called
<i>Munich King</i> (<i>Zeus</i>?), of the Glyptothek, which Furtwaengler has
shown to be a work of about 460 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_1609"></a><a href="#Footnote_1609" class="fnanchor">1609</a></p>

<p>Does the <i>Doryphoros</i> represent a pentathlete victor? Since Quintilian
says that it appears ready for war or for the exercises of the palæstra,<a id="FNanchor_1610"></a><a href="#Footnote_1610" class="fnanchor">1610</a>
Helbig and others have classed it as a warrior, perhaps one of the <i>Achilleae</i>
mentioned by Pliny<a id="FNanchor_1611"></a><a href="#Footnote_1611" class="fnanchor">1611</a> as set up in the Greek gymnasia. Furtwaengler
stressed the incorrectness of calling an athlete a <i>Doryphoros</i><a id="FNanchor_1612"></a><a href="#Footnote_1612" class="fnanchor">1612</a>—a
name originally given to an attendant bearing a lance (δόρυ), and
so inapplicable to the statue of Polykleitos, which represented not a
server, but an athlete carrying an akontion (witness the Berlin gem
already mentioned)—but later<a id="FNanchor_1613"></a><a href="#Footnote_1613" class="fnanchor">1613</a> concluded that an athlete statue with
the akontion might have been vaguely described in late art jargon as a
spear-bearer. Consequently he found probable the interpretation of the
various <i>doryphoroi</i> mentioned by Pliny<a id="FNanchor_1614"></a><a href="#Footnote_1614" class="fnanchor">1614</a> as victor statues, and thought
that the original of the <i>Doryphoros</i> of Polykleitos might very well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
have represented an Olympic pentathlete, which was originally set up
at Argos, where it was also adopted for a figure on the heroic grave-relief
already mentioned, which represented the youth with a spear over
his shoulder standing beside a horse. Bulle also thinks that the statue
represented a victor athlete set up in some sacred spot.</p>

<p>For its interpretation as the statue of a pentathlete victor, an added
proof is furnished by the discovery of a late Roman copy of it at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_1615"></a><a href="#Footnote_1615" class="fnanchor">1615</a>
This may very well have been the dedication of an athlete of
late date—of the first century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> or of the first <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span>—who preferred
to be represented by a copy of the famous work of Polykleitos rather
than by a new statue. Treu’s contention that the torso is too large for
a victor statue,<a id="FNanchor_1616"></a><a href="#Footnote_1616" class="fnanchor">1616</a> because Lucian says that the Hellanodikai did not allow
statues of victors to be over life-size,<a id="FNanchor_1617"></a><a href="#Footnote_1617" class="fnanchor">1617</a> falls to the ground, since we know
that exceptions to the rule existed at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_1618"></a><a href="#Footnote_1618" class="fnanchor">1618</a> He agrees with Collignon<a id="FNanchor_1619"></a><a href="#Footnote_1619" class="fnanchor">1619</a>
in interpreting it as a decorative statue, which surely involves
an anachronism in the middle of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>; and his argument
that its good preservation shows it to have been set up in an interior
room, perhaps of the Bouleuterion, in whose ruins it was found, adducing
this as additional evidence of its decorative character, is no proof,
since victor statues at Olympia seem sometimes to have been housed.<a id="FNanchor_1620"></a><a href="#Footnote_1620" class="fnanchor">1620</a>
Thus the theory that the <i>Doryphoros</i> represents a pentathlete victor
is well within the range of possibilities.</p>

<p>Two bronze statuettes in the Metropolitan Museum,<a id="FNanchor_1621"></a><a href="#Footnote_1621" class="fnanchor">1621</a> New York,
belonging to the second half of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, may be representations
on a small scale of pentathletes with the <i>akontion</i>. The first
shows a youth standing with the weight of the body on the left foot, the
right drawn slightly back. The left hand, held close to the side, may
have carried an akontion, the right arm being extended. The other,
more carelessly executed, represents a youth standing similarly with his
weight on the left foot, the right being drawn back. Here again the
left arm is hanging by the side, and probably held the same attribute as
the first statuette. The right arm is also bent at the elbow. A patera
may have been held in the outstretched hand of each. The square<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
build, short thighs, flat abdomen, long skull, and oval face are all
Polykleitan characteristics, and remind us of the series of kindred
works already discussed, which, as Furtwaengler believed, went back to
the original statue of the boy wrestler Xenokles at Olympia, the work
of the younger Polykleitos.<a id="FNanchor_1622"></a><a href="#Footnote_1622" class="fnanchor">1622</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Wrestlers.</span></h4>

<p>Wrestling (πάλη) is perhaps the oldest, and in any case is the most
universal, of athletic sports. Wall-paintings at Beni-Hasan on the Nile,
dating from about 2000 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, show nearly all the grips and throws now
known.<a id="FNanchor_1623"></a><a href="#Footnote_1623" class="fnanchor">1623</a> Plato says that this sport was instituted in mythical times.<a id="FNanchor_1624"></a><a href="#Footnote_1624" class="fnanchor">1624</a>
In Greece its origin is lost in mythology.<a id="FNanchor_1625"></a><a href="#Footnote_1625" class="fnanchor">1625</a> The very name <i>palaistra</i>,
“wrestling school,” indicates the early importance of the contest.
It was one of the most popular of Greek sports from the time of Homer
down.<a id="FNanchor_1626"></a><a href="#Footnote_1626" class="fnanchor">1626</a> This popularity is shown by the frequency with which
it appears in mythology and art. Early b.-f. vases picture Herakles
wrestling with giants and monsters. Here we see the same holds
and throws as in the palæstra scenes on later r.-f. vases. The whole
history of coins down to imperial days shows such scenes. No other
exercise required so much strength and agility, and consequently wrestling
matches early became a part of the great games. At Olympia
wrestling was introduced in Ol. 18 (&#8239;=&#8239;708 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), the same year in which
the pentathlon was instituted.<a id="FNanchor_1627"></a><a href="#Footnote_1627" class="fnanchor">1627</a> The boys’ match appeared there less
than a century later in Ol. 37 (&#8239;=&#8239;632 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_1628"></a><a href="#Footnote_1628" class="fnanchor">1628</a> Pausanias mentions
statues erected to 36 victors (for 45 victories), which makes this contest
second only in importance to boxing there.</p>

<p>There were two sorts of wrestling in Greece, wrestling in the proper
sense (ὀρθὴ πάλη), where each tried to throw his antagonist to the
ground, making his shoulders touch three times, and ground wrestling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
(κύλισις, ἁλίνδησις), where the fight was continued on the ground by
using every means, except biting and gouging, till one was exhausted.
The first kind was the only one used in the event called πάλη at Olympia,
as well as in the pentathlon; the other was used only in the pankration.
In this section we shall discuss only the first.<a id="FNanchor_1629"></a><a href="#Footnote_1629" class="fnanchor">1629</a> A recently
discovered papyrus of the second century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span>, containing brief
instructions for wrestling lessons intended to help the παιδοτρίβης, indicates
that every movement in the contest was systematically taught.<a id="FNanchor_1630"></a><a href="#Footnote_1630" class="fnanchor">1630</a>
The various positions used—grips and throws—are shown by many
monuments, vase-paintings, gems, coins,<a id="FNanchor_1631"></a><a href="#Footnote_1631" class="fnanchor">1631</a> statuettes, and statues. The
vases<a id="FNanchor_1632"></a><a href="#Footnote_1632" class="fnanchor">1632</a> especially illustrate the various holds assumed by wrestlers
during a bout—front (σύστασις), side (παράθεσις), wrist, arm, neck
(τραχηλίζειν), and body holds. Still others illustrate the various
throws—flying mare,<a id="FNanchor_1633"></a><a href="#Footnote_1633" class="fnanchor">1633</a> heave,<a id="FNanchor_1634"></a><a href="#Footnote_1634" class="fnanchor">1634</a> buttocks and cross-buttocks (ἕδραν
στρέφειν), and tripping (ὑποσκελίζειν). We here reproduce two such
paintings. The first, the obverse of a r.-f. amphora from Vulci, signed
by Andokides and now in Berlin (Fig. <a href="#f49">49</a>),<a id="FNanchor_1635"></a><a href="#Footnote_1635" class="fnanchor">1635</a> shows two positions. In
the central group the wrestler on the left side has grasped his opponent’s
left wrist with his right hand. The latter, however, has rendered
the grip useless by passing his own right hand behind his
opponent’s back and grasping his right arm just below the elbow.
In this way he keeps his opponent from turning round, which movement
would not have been possible if the latter had grasped him
by the upper arm. In the group of wrestlers to the right we see an
illustration of a body hold. Here a youthful athlete has lifted his
bearded antagonist clear off his feet preliminary to throwing him.
However, the one lifted from the ground has caught his foot around his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
opponent’s leg, which is an illustration of tripping. On a r.-f. kylix
in the University of Pennsylvania Museum in Philadelphia (Fig. <a href="#f50">50</a>a),<a id="FNanchor_1636"></a><a href="#Footnote_1636" class="fnanchor">1636</a>
we see a body hold preparatory to the heave; here to the right are two
youths wrestling, and to the left stands a bearded trainer with his rod.
One wrestler has already lost his balance and is supporting himself
with both hands on the ground, while the other with his left hand holds
the other’s right arm down, and with his right prepares to throw him
over his head.</p>

<p>From vase-paintings, then, we can see what positions the sculptor
might have used in representing groups of wrestlers. For the positions
of individual figures of wrestlers, we are guided by several
statues and small bronzes. The preliminary position (σύστασις)
seems to be best represented by the bronze statues of wrestling
boys discovered at Herculaneum in 1754, and now in the Museum of
Naples (Fig. <a href="#f51">51</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1637"></a><a href="#Footnote_1637" class="fnanchor">1637</a> These figures have been variously interpreted as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
runners,<a id="FNanchor_1638"></a><a href="#Footnote_1638" class="fnanchor">1638</a> diskoboloi,<a id="FNanchor_1639"></a><a href="#Footnote_1639" class="fnanchor">1639</a> and wrestlers. Their attitude, bent forward
with outstretched hands, implies the utmost expectancy. If they
were runners, they would lean further forward; as they are standing,
they could not begin to run without loss of time in raising the heels of
the forward feet. If, on the other hand, they represented diskos-throwers
at the moment just subsequent to the throw, their right
feet would be advanced and not their left, in order to recover their
balance, as we have seen above in considering Gardiner’s seventh
position. The position of their arms, however, and the expression
of their faces make it almost certain that they are wrestlers eagerly
watching for an opening. The two statues certainly belong together,
and may have been set up as antagonists in the villa in whose ruins they
were found. F. Hauser was the first to show that the form of body
and head in both was the same.<a id="FNanchor_1640"></a><a href="#Footnote_1640" class="fnanchor">1640</a> While most critics believe that they
are Hellenistic in origin, Bulle is certainly right in showing that the body
ideal expressed is Lysippan—<i>i. e.</i>, long legs and slender trunk—even
if he goes too far in ascribing them to the master himself, basing his
conclusion chiefly on the similarity of their ears with those of the
<i>Apoxyomenos</i> (Pl. <a href="#p29">29</a>). A good illustration of a hand or wrist grip
is afforded by a small wrestler group, which decorates the rim of a
bronze bowl from Borsdorf.<a id="FNanchor_1641"></a><a href="#Footnote_1641" class="fnanchor">1641</a> This is a poorly wrought Etruscan work of
fifth-century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> Greek origin. The two wrestlers have already gripped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
and their heads are close together, though the lunge in each case is much
exaggerated. Similar are the two groups on the rim of a bronze bowl
in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.<a id="FNanchor_1642"></a><a href="#Footnote_1642" class="fnanchor">1642</a> A third-century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> Etruscan
cista in the Metropolitan Museum,<a id="FNanchor_1643"></a><a href="#Footnote_1643" class="fnanchor">1643</a> has a handle on the lid in the form
of two nude wrestlers, whose bodies are inclined toward one another,
their heads in contact, and their arms locked behind their heads.
Groups of wrestlers in similar attitudes commonly appear as cista handles.<a id="FNanchor_1644"></a><a href="#Footnote_1644" class="fnanchor">1644</a>
A portion of a bronze group of wrestlers was dredged from the
sea near Kythera and is now in Athens.<a id="FNanchor_1645"></a><a href="#Footnote_1645" class="fnanchor">1645</a> The heave is represented
by a metope from the Theseion representing the wrestling bout
between Theseus and Kerkyon.<a id="FNanchor_1646"></a><a href="#Footnote_1646" class="fnanchor">1646</a> A later moment is seen in a bronze
wrestling-group in Paris.<a id="FNanchor_1647"></a><a href="#Footnote_1647" class="fnanchor">1647</a> The cross-buttocks is illustrated by a small
Hellenistic bronze group in the collection of James Loeb in Munich, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
which five other copies are known.<a id="FNanchor_1648"></a><a href="#Footnote_1648" class="fnanchor">1648</a> Here two athletes, one bearded
and the other beardless, are just ending the bout. The youth is in the
power of the man, who stands behind him and presses him down by
holding his arms backward. All the other replicas differ from the Loeb
example in that the victor has both legs and not one in front of the right
leg of the vanquished wrestler. A good illustration of tripping is seen
in another related series of groups known to us in five bronze copies.
These represent a wrestler on the ground supporting himself on his
left arm, while over him stands the victor, whose left foot is twisted
around the other’s right. These groups are, like the preceding, also
Roman provincial copies of a Hellenistic original.<a id="FNanchor_1649"></a><a href="#Footnote_1649" class="fnanchor">1649</a> The two groups
are very similar, the only real difference being that the vanquished
wrestler in the second series still has his left arm free and holds himself
up on his right knee. Both series seem to have been influenced
by the marble pancratiast group in the Uffizi (Pl. <a href="#p25">25</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1650"></a><a href="#Footnote_1650" class="fnanchor">1650</a> The head of
an athlete in the Museo delle Terme, Rome,<a id="FNanchor_1651"></a><a href="#Footnote_1651" class="fnanchor">1651</a> shows by its strongly
projecting neck that it comes from the statue either of a runner ready
to start or of a wrestler about to grip his adversary. The face is fourth-century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> Attic in character and the head may, therefore, come from
Euphranor’s circle. Pliny speaks of a panting wrestler (<i>luctator anhelans</i>)
by the statuary Naukeros, which must have exhibited the contestant
in intense movement.<a id="FNanchor_1652"></a><a href="#Footnote_1652" class="fnanchor">1652</a> It might have represented him after
victory, as in the painting of Parrhasios discussed above, which
pictured a hoplitodrome after the race, breathing hard.<a id="FNanchor_1653"></a><a href="#Footnote_1653" class="fnanchor">1653</a> Pliny also
mentions a painting of a wrestler by Antidotos without describing it.<a id="FNanchor_1654"></a><a href="#Footnote_1654" class="fnanchor">1654</a>
As we have already remarked, doubtless some of the <i>apoxyomenoi</i>
and <i>perixyomenoi</i> mentioned by Pliny were also wrestlers.</p>

<p>Whether wrestling-groups were set up at Olympia is doubtful. Chariot-groups
were indeed common, but there is no reason why the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
victorious wrestler should have had himself coupled with his defeated
opponent. Pausanias, moreover, mentions no such groups. We are
therefore safe in inferring that in most, if not in all, cases the wrestler
would content himself with a single statue, and this might represent
him in any position in which he was not actually interlocked with his
adversary. That such statues represented him both in repose and in
motion is attested by recovered bases. The footprints on the base of the
statue of the Elean wrestler Paianios, a victor of the early third century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>,<a id="FNanchor_1655"></a><a href="#Footnote_1655" class="fnanchor">1655</a> shows us that he was represented as standing in repose, the weight
of the body resting on the right leg, the left being drawn back and touching
the ground with the toes only. A hole in the base may have been
for a spear on which the victor’s hand rested, though the statue is not
that of a pentathlete. The perfectly preserved footprints on the base
of the statue of the boy wrestler Xenokles by Polykleitos the Younger
show that he was represented as standing with his weight on the right
leg, the left being slightly advanced and to one side, though resting
flat on the ground. The head was probably turned a little to the right.
Thus the wrestler was poised ready to grip his adversary.<a id="FNanchor_1656"></a><a href="#Footnote_1656" class="fnanchor">1656</a> This statue
must have been a favorite among athlete monuments, since the same
motive appears in various Roman copies, which Furtwaengler assigns
to the immediate circle of the pupils of Polykleitos. The statue of
the Argive wrestler Cheimon by Naukydes may have represented him
in motion, since Pausanias, in mentioning two statues of the victor,
one in Olympia and the other in the temple of Concord at Rome, says
that they were among the most famous works of that sculptor. From
this encomium Reisch has assumed that the one at Olympia was
represented in lively motion.<a id="FNanchor_1657"></a><a href="#Footnote_1657" class="fnanchor">1657</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Boxers.</span></h4>

<p>Boxing, like wrestling, was one of the oldest sports in Greece, as it
has been everywhere else. The fist is the simplest and most natural
of all weapons.<a id="FNanchor_1658"></a><a href="#Footnote_1658" class="fnanchor">1658</a> Boxing was popular already in Homer, matches being
described both in the Iliad and the Odyssey.<a id="FNanchor_1659"></a><a href="#Footnote_1659" class="fnanchor">1659</a> Homer speaks of it as
πυγμαχίη ἀλεγεινή,<a id="FNanchor_1660"></a><a href="#Footnote_1660" class="fnanchor">1660</a> and this “painful” character is also mentioned by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
Xenophanes.<a id="FNanchor_1661"></a><a href="#Footnote_1661" class="fnanchor">1661</a> However, boxing was far older than epic poetry. We have
already seen that it was the only form of real athletics in Aegean Crete.
One of the oldest representations of a boxing match is seen on the fragments
of a bronze shield discovered there in the grotto of Zeus on
Mount Ida. Here on a single concentric ring are seen two warriors,
armed like Assyrians with corslets, shields, and helmets, fighting with
doubled fists.<a id="FNanchor_1662"></a><a href="#Footnote_1662" class="fnanchor">1662</a> The high antiquity of boxing in Greece is also shown
by myths.<a id="FNanchor_1663"></a><a href="#Footnote_1663" class="fnanchor">1663</a> At Olympia Apollo is said to have beaten Ares,<a id="FNanchor_1664"></a><a href="#Footnote_1664" class="fnanchor">1664</a> and Polydeukes
won a victory there.<a id="FNanchor_1665"></a><a href="#Footnote_1665" class="fnanchor">1665</a> Apollo appears as the god of boxing in the
Iliad,<a id="FNanchor_1666"></a><a href="#Footnote_1666" class="fnanchor">1666</a> and the Delphians sacrificed to Apollo Πύκτης.<a id="FNanchor_1667"></a><a href="#Footnote_1667" class="fnanchor">1667</a> Herakles,
Polydeukes, Tydeus, and Theseus were all famed boxers; the latter
was said to have invented the art.<a id="FNanchor_1668"></a><a href="#Footnote_1668" class="fnanchor">1668</a> The historical boxing match
was introduced at Olympia in Ol. 23 (&#8239;=&#8239;688 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), and Onomastos of
Smyrna, the first victor, instituted the rules of the contest.<a id="FNanchor_1669"></a><a href="#Footnote_1669" class="fnanchor">1669</a> The
boys’ contest was instituted in Ol. 41 (&#8239;=&#8239;616 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_1670"></a><a href="#Footnote_1670" class="fnanchor">1670</a> It was by far the
most popular contest there. Of the 192 monuments erected to 187
victors mentioned by Pausanias, 56, or nearly one-third, were erected
to men and boy boxers for 63 victories.</p>

<p>Greek boxing<a id="FNanchor_1671"></a><a href="#Footnote_1671" class="fnanchor">1671</a> is conveniently divided into two periods by the kind
of glove used in the matches. From Homer down to the end of the
fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, soft gloves (ἱμάντες, ἱμάντες λεπτοί or μειλίχαι) were
used; from then to late Roman days the heavy gloves (σφαῖραι or ἱμάντες
ὀξεῖς) were the fashion. The weighted Roman cestus was not used
in the Greek contest. Before discussing representations of boxers
in art, we shall devote a few words to these two kinds of boxing-gloves,
which frequently give us the date of a given monument.<a id="FNanchor_1672"></a><a href="#Footnote_1672" class="fnanchor">1672</a> The Cretans
are thought to have worn boxing-gloves, as they seem to be visible
on the so-called <i>Boxer Vase</i> from Hagia Triada (Fig. <a href="#f1">1</a>). Here, on the
top and lower two rows, a leather gauntlet appears to cover the arm to
beyond the elbow, being padded over the fist and confined at the wrist
by a strap. Mosso derives the later Greek glove, which appears on
athlete statues, from this primitive thong.<a id="FNanchor_1673"></a><a href="#Footnote_1673" class="fnanchor">1673</a> In any case the antiquity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
of the glove in Greece is attested by its origin being ascribed to the
myth of Amykos, king of the Bebrykes.<a id="FNanchor_1674"></a><a href="#Footnote_1674" class="fnanchor">1674</a> Gloves were already known to
Homer, who speaks of “well-cut thongs of ox-hide.”<a id="FNanchor_1675"></a><a href="#Footnote_1675" class="fnanchor">1675</a> They are not
mentioned in any detail before the time of Pausanias and Philostratos,
so that we are mostly dependent for our knowledge of them on the
monuments. The simplest form consisted of long, thin ox-hide thongs,
which were wound round the hands, the soft gloves (ἱμάντες μαλακώτεροι
or μειλίχαι) of later writers.<a id="FNanchor_1676"></a><a href="#Footnote_1676" class="fnanchor">1676</a> They were used, not to deaden
the blow, but to increase its force. Vase-paintings show that the thongs
were about 10 or 12 feet long before being wound.<a id="FNanchor_1677"></a><a href="#Footnote_1677" class="fnanchor">1677</a> On the exterior
of a r.-f. kylix from Vulci by Douris, in the British Museum, showing
chiefly boxing scenes, we see two youths standing before a <i>paidotribes</i>
preparing to put on the thongs (Fig. <a href="#f54">54</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1678"></a><a href="#Footnote_1678" class="fnanchor">1678</a> One of them is holding the
unwound thong in his outstretched hands. A similar figure appears
on the r.-f. vase in Philadelphia already discussed (Fig. <a href="#f50">50</a>b), which
represents a palæstra scene.<a id="FNanchor_1679"></a><a href="#Footnote_1679" class="fnanchor">1679</a> This scene has been wrongly interpreted
as an illustration of the game of σκαπέρδη described by Pollux<a id="FNanchor_1680"></a><a href="#Footnote_1680" class="fnanchor">1680</a> as a
sort of tug-of-war, the unwound thong being explained as the rope used
in this game,<a id="FNanchor_1681"></a><a href="#Footnote_1681" class="fnanchor">1681</a> and the hurling-sticks stuck in the ground at either end
as goals instead of akontia. A wound thong is seen hanging on the wall
to the left. Philostratos describes how the boxing thongs were put on,<a id="FNanchor_1682"></a><a href="#Footnote_1682" class="fnanchor">1682</a>
and vase-paintings illustrate the method.<a id="FNanchor_1683"></a><a href="#Footnote_1683" class="fnanchor">1683</a> The best example of the
thongs on statuary is afforded by the bronze arm found in the sea off
Antikythera (Cerigotto) (Fig. <a href="#f52">52</a>), which Svoronos<a id="FNanchor_1684"></a><a href="#Footnote_1684" class="fnanchor">1684</a> believes to be a remnant
of the statue of the Nemean victor Kreugas of Epidamnos, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
stood in the temple of Apollo Lykios in Argos.<a id="FNanchor_1685"></a><a href="#Footnote_1685" class="fnanchor">1685</a> Pausanias says that
Kreugas was crowned notwithstanding that he was killed by his adversary
Damoxenos, and his description of the soft glove corresponds so
closely with the one on the recovered arm that it seems as if it had been
written in the presence of the statue: “In those days boxers did not yet
wear the sharp thong (ἱμὰς ὀξύς) on each wrist, but boxed with the soft
straps (μειλίχαις), which they fastened under the hollow of the hand in
order that the fingers might be left bare; these soft straps were thin
thongs (ἱμάντες λεπτοί) of raw cowhide, plaited together in an ancient
fashion.”<a id="FNanchor_1686"></a><a href="#Footnote_1686" class="fnanchor">1686</a> The strap allowed the ends of the fingers to project, and was
held together by a cord wound around the forearm, just as Philostratos
says. These μειλίχαι were used at the great games through the fifth
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, and were continued in the palæstra in the fourth. Early
in the latter century the σφαῖραι mentioned by Plato<a id="FNanchor_1687"></a><a href="#Footnote_1687" class="fnanchor">1687</a> and other writers
appeared. We see them on Panathenaic vases of that century and on
Etruscan cistæ of the following one.<a id="FNanchor_1688"></a><a href="#Footnote_1688" class="fnanchor">1688</a> About the same time the regular
ἱμάντες ὀξεῖς came in,<a id="FNanchor_1689"></a><a href="#Footnote_1689" class="fnanchor">1689</a> but the old μειλίχαι or something similar
were still used in the exercises of the palæstra.<a id="FNanchor_1690"></a><a href="#Footnote_1690" class="fnanchor">1690</a></p>

<p>Our best illustration of these more formidable gloves on statuary is
the gauntlet clearly represented on the forearms of the <i>Seated Boxer</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
of the Museo delle Terme (Fig. <a href="#f53">53</a>). Here a close-fitting glove covers
each forearm, leaving the upper joints of the fingers free and the palm
open. It extends to above the wrist and ends in a rim of fur. Over it
are drawn three thick bands of leather, which cover the first joints of
the fingers and are fastened together on the outside of the hands with
metal clasps. A soft pad keeps these bands from chafing the fingers.
They are kept in place and the wrists are strengthened by two narrow
straps which are interlaced several times around hand and wrist.
Similar gloves appear on the Sorrento boxer in Naples (Fig. <a href="#f57">57</a>),<a id="FNanchor_1691"></a><a href="#Footnote_1691" class="fnanchor">1691</a> on the
bronze forearm of a statue from Herculaneum in Naples,<a id="FNanchor_1692"></a><a href="#Footnote_1692" class="fnanchor">1692</a> on a left fist
found in 1887 in the arena at Verona,<a id="FNanchor_1693"></a><a href="#Footnote_1693" class="fnanchor">1693</a> and on many other statues and
fragments. The last representation in art of this sort of glove appears
on the Roman relief in the Lateran, which dates from the time of
Trajan, and represents a fight between two pugilists.<a id="FNanchor_1694"></a><a href="#Footnote_1694" class="fnanchor">1694</a> The metal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
cestus was a Roman invention. None of the late Greek writers—neither
Plutarch, nor Pausanias, nor Philostratos—makes any mention
of this loaded glove. The “sharp thongs” were enough to cause
all the injuries mentioned by the writers of the <i>Greek Anthology</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1695"></a><a href="#Footnote_1695" class="fnanchor">1695</a>
The cestus, perhaps used in the later gladiatorial shows in Greece,
but never in the great games there, gave the death blow to real
boxing. Virgil describes it and the vicious results of its use.<a id="FNanchor_1696"></a><a href="#Footnote_1696" class="fnanchor">1696</a></p>

<p>There are fewer representations of boxing matches on vases than of
almost any other Greek sport, despite its great popularity. Gardiner
has collected a number of vase-paintings dating from the sixth to the
fourth centuries <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, which illustrate the different positions assumed
by boxers in action—attack, slipping, ducking, and leg and arm movements.
We reproduce two from r.-f. kylikes in the British Museum. In
one by Douris (Fig. <a href="#f54">54</a>)<a id="FNanchor_1697"></a><a href="#Footnote_1697" class="fnanchor">1697</a> we have, besides the group already mentioned
of two athletes preparing to put on thongs, three pairs of boxers engaged
in a bout. In two groups one of the contestants is seen from behind; in
all three the boxers extend their left arms for guarding and draw the
right back for hitting—the fists being level with the shoulders. In one
group we see the beginning of the fight, in the other two the middle,
perhaps, and the end of it, respectively. In the last scene one contestant
has fallen to the ground on his knee, and his conqueror has
swung his right hand far back for a final blow, only to be stopped by
the other, who raises his finger in token of defeat. On the other vase
we see, besides a scene from the pankration, two pairs of boxers
sparring (Fig. <a href="#f55">55</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1698"></a><a href="#Footnote_1698" class="fnanchor">1698</a> Here in one group the contestants do not have
their fists doubled, but keep their fingers opened. On an Attic b.-f.
Panathenaic panel-amphora in the University Museum in Philadelphia
(Fig. <a href="#f56">56</a>),<a id="FNanchor_1699"></a><a href="#Footnote_1699" class="fnanchor">1699</a> we see bearded boxers sparring, while a boxer with
thongs in his right hand stands to the right, and a trainer with his rod
at the left. Statues of victorious boxers at Olympia were represented
either in motion, <i>i. e.</i>, probably in the position of sparring, or in repose,
like that of the boy boxer Kyniskos by the elder Polykleitos discussed in
the preceding chapter. The same foot position visible on the <i>Kyniskos</i>
base<a id="FNanchor_1700"></a><a href="#Footnote_1700" class="fnanchor">1700</a> occurs on two other Olympia bases, which, therefore, must have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
supported Polykleitan statues represented in repose. One of these, in
the form of an <i>astragalos</i>, will be discussed further on in our treatment
of pancratiast statues; the other supported the statue of the boy boxer
Hellanikos of Lepreon, who won a victory in Ol. 89 (&#8239;=&#8239;424 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_1701"></a><a href="#Footnote_1701" class="fnanchor">1701</a> In
this case the statue was also life-size, the left foot was firmly placed, and
the right was set back resting on the ball, the stride being a little longer
than in the case of the <i>Kyniskos</i>. Three other Olympia bases supported
statues of boxers represented in repose, those of the boy Tellon from
the Arkadian town Oresthasion,<a id="FNanchor_1702"></a><a href="#Footnote_1702" class="fnanchor">1702</a> of the Epidaurian Aristion by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
elder Polykleitos,<a id="FNanchor_1703"></a><a href="#Footnote_1703" class="fnanchor">1703</a> and of the Rhodian Eukles by Naukydes of the
Polykleitan circle.<a id="FNanchor_1704"></a><a href="#Footnote_1704" class="fnanchor">1704</a> Furtwaengler believed that a number of existing
statues of the Hermes type reproduced the statue of Aristion, because of
a similar foot position. Among them the Pentelic marble one in
Lansdowne House, London, is the best preserved, and most faithfully
reproduces the Polykleitan style.<a id="FNanchor_1705"></a><a href="#Footnote_1705" class="fnanchor">1705</a></p>

<p>We may infer how a Polykleitan statue of a boxer at rest looked, from
the Roman copy of one in Kassel.<a id="FNanchor_1706"></a><a href="#Footnote_1706" class="fnanchor">1706</a>
Here a youth just out of boyhood is
represented as standing with the weight of the body resting upon the right
leg and the head turned to the right. The forearms are covered with
gloves, the right fist being raised for attack and the left for defense.

we know as a copyist of the first century
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span>, and who was active in reproducing Greek works for the Roman
market.<a id="FNanchor_1708"></a><a href="#Footnote_1708" class="fnanchor">1708</a> The body forms are too badly injured for us accurately to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
date the original from which this copy was made, but the head gives us
the clue, as its style appears to be a connecting link between that of
the seated statue of <i>Herakles</i>, in the Palazzo Altemps in Rome<a id="FNanchor_1709"></a><a href="#Footnote_1709" class="fnanchor">1709</a> and
the Munich <i>Oil-pourer</i> (Pl. <a href="#p11">11</a>),<a id="FNanchor_1710"></a><a href="#Footnote_1710" class="fnanchor">1710</a> as it shows affinity to both. Though
Sogliano referred it to the school of Lysippos and Juethner to the
beginning of the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, it shows indubitable Myronian
characteristics and may have been the work of Myron’s pupil Lykios,
who is known to us as an athlete sculptor.<a id="FNanchor_1711"></a><a href="#Footnote_1711" class="fnanchor">1711</a> In this statue the youth
is resting his weight on his right leg, the left, with full sole on the
ground, being turned to one side. The left forearm is extended outwards
and to the side, the head leaning toward the right leg—in other
words, the athlete is represented in an attitude similar to that of the
<i>Idolino</i> (Pl. <a href="#p14">14</a>). As there is an olive crown in the hair, it seems reasonable
to conclude that the original statue was that of an Olympic victor.</p>

<p>By the beginning of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, if not earlier, boxers were
represented in violent motion, as we saw in the case of the statue of the
boy boxer Glaukos, by the Aeginetan sculptor Glaukias,<a id="FNanchor_1712"></a><a href="#Footnote_1712" class="fnanchor">1712</a> represented in
the act of sparring (σκιαμαχῶν). Whether he was represented as facing
an imaginary antagonist or as merely punching a bag we can not say,
though the latter seems the more probable. The motive is depicted in
many art works, notably in the figure of a youth punching a bag which
hangs from a tree on the Ficoroni cista in the Museo Kircheriano, Rome,<a id="FNanchor_1713"></a><a href="#Footnote_1713" class="fnanchor">1713</a>
and in that of another represented on the so-called Peter cista in the
Museo Gregoriano Etrusco of the Vatican, whose engraved scenes show
exercises of the palæstra.<a id="FNanchor_1714"></a><a href="#Footnote_1714" class="fnanchor">1714</a> The same motive is seen also in a statuette
in the Museo Chiaramonti of the Vatican, which is proved to be that
of a boy boxer by the glove on the right hand.<a id="FNanchor_1715"></a><a href="#Footnote_1715" class="fnanchor">1715</a> Here the boy is represented
with the right foot far advanced and rising on the toes
of both feet, the right shoulder being drawn back, the right forearm
raised, and the left extended forwards. The marble torso of a copy
of the same original on a large scale is in Berlin.<a id="FNanchor_1716"></a><a href="#Footnote_1716" class="fnanchor">1716</a> While Amelung<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
believes that the original of both statuette and torso was a bronze
of the second half of the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, Furtwaengler thought that
the torso went back to the severe style of the fifth century, and that
this original once stood in Olympia, where it might have served as the
inspiration for a carelessly worked bronze statuette of a boxer found
there, which repeats the motive of the torso and similarly belongs to
the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> (Fig. <a href="#f2">2</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1717"></a><a href="#Footnote_1717" class="fnanchor">1717</a> The Olympia statuette also has the
right foot advanced, the upper part of the body leans backward, and
the left arm with open palm is outstretched for defense, while the
right with balled fist is held up ready to strike. It certainly is a votive
offering of an Olympic victor—doubtless one of the small reductions,
which were not uncommonly erected for economy’s sake.<a id="FNanchor_1718"></a><a href="#Footnote_1718" class="fnanchor">1718</a> Whether
the Aeginetan Glaukias also made victor statues in repose is doubtful.</p>

<p>Waldstein, on insufficient grounds, has argued that the so-called
<i>Strangford Apollo</i> in the British Museum (Fig. <a href="#f14">14</a>)<a id="FNanchor_1719"></a><a href="#Footnote_1719" class="fnanchor">1719</a> is a copy of the
statue at Olympia of the famous Thasian boxer and pancratiast
Theagenes by Glaukias. Its close observation of nature finds its
analogy in the statues of the Aeginetan pediment groups (see Figs. 20,
21). The statue of the boy boxer Athenaios of Ephesos, by an unknown
sculptor, was represented as lunging at his adversary, as we see
from the footmarks on the recovered base. The left foot was advanced
and turned outwards, while the right one touched the ground only with
the toes.<a id="FNanchor_1720"></a><a href="#Footnote_1720" class="fnanchor">1720</a> Similarly the statue of the boxer Damoxenidas by Nikodamos
of Arkadia was represented as about to strike. On its recovered
base the left foot stood solidly upon the ground, while the right foot
was drawn back and touched the ground only with the toes—if we
judge rightly from the size of the missing part of the stone.<a id="FNanchor_1721"></a><a href="#Footnote_1721" class="fnanchor">1721</a> The
statue of the Ionian boxer Epitherses by Pythokritos of Rhodes seems
to have had but one foot flat upon the ground, and consequently must
have been represented in motion, though we are not sure of the position
of the other, since one stone of the base is missing.<a id="FNanchor_1722"></a><a href="#Footnote_1722" class="fnanchor">1722</a></p>

<p>The bronze plate from the base of the statue of the boy boxer
Philippos, an Azanian of Pellene, was found at Olympia and has been
referred to the end of the fourth or beginning of the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_1723"></a><a href="#Footnote_1723" class="fnanchor">1723</a>

However, since Pausanias says that Myron made the statue,<a id="FNanchor_1724"></a><a href="#Footnote_1724" class="fnanchor">1724</a> various
attempts have been made to reconcile the discrepancy in dates. Our
own solution is that the statue seen by Pausanias did not represent
Philippos at all, but some earlier unnamed Arkadian boxer, who was
contemporary with Myron.<a id="FNanchor_1725"></a><a href="#Footnote_1725" class="fnanchor">1725</a> Years later the Azanian boy Philippos

won a victory at Olympia and attached
the recovered epigram to the
old base, in which he implored Zeus
to let the ancient glory of Arkadia
be revived in him, and also a newer
one in which he said that he had restored
the statue of Myron.<a id="FNanchor_1726"></a><a href="#Footnote_1726" class="fnanchor">1726</a> Pausanias
saw the newer one, but omitted
to mention the older, which was probably
illegible from weathering. He
therefore thought that the original
Myronian statue used by Philippos
represented the latter victor.<a id="FNanchor_1727"></a><a href="#Footnote_1727" class="fnanchor">1727</a> The
words on the affixed plate beginning
ὧδε στὰς ὁ Πελασγὸς ἐπ’ Ἀλφειῷ ποκα

of the boxer rather than to a
portrait of the victor.<a id="FNanchor_1728"></a><a href="#Footnote_1728" class="fnanchor">1728</a> We have
long ago hazarded the suggestion<a id="FNanchor_1729"></a><a href="#Footnote_1729" class="fnanchor">1729</a>
that the so-called <i>Pollux</i> of the
Louvre (Fig. <a href="#f58">58</a>),<a id="FNanchor_1730"></a><a href="#Footnote_1730" class="fnanchor">1730</a> whose body forms
recall the <i>Marsyas</i> and whose head
recalls the <i>Diskobolos</i>, may go back
to the statue of the unnamed Arkadian
by Myron.<a id="FNanchor_1731"></a><a href="#Footnote_1731" class="fnanchor">1731</a> But the uncertainty
which we have found in a
former section<a id="FNanchor_1732"></a><a href="#Footnote_1732" class="fnanchor">1732</a> in assigning this and

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Pancratiasts.</span></h4>

<p>The pankration (παγκράτιον)<a id="FNanchor_1733"></a><a href="#Footnote_1733" class="fnanchor">1733</a> was a combination of boxing and wrestling,
in which the contestants fought either standing, or prone on the
ground. While the wrestler merely tried to throw his opponent in a
series of bouts, the pancratiast continued the fight on the ground until
one or the other acknowledged defeat. The etymology of the word
shows that it was a contest in which every power of the contestants
was exerted to the utmost.<a id="FNanchor_1734"></a><a href="#Footnote_1734" class="fnanchor">1734</a> Strangling, pummeling, kicking, and, in
fact, everything but biting and gouging were allowed. Both Lucian<a id="FNanchor_1735"></a><a href="#Footnote_1735" class="fnanchor">1735</a>
and Philostratos<a id="FNanchor_1736"></a><a href="#Footnote_1736" class="fnanchor">1736</a> speak of the prohibition against biting and gouging,
which statements Gardiner thinks are quotations from the rules governing
the contest at Olympia, as they are twice quoted by Aristophanes.<a id="FNanchor_1737"></a><a href="#Footnote_1737" class="fnanchor">1737</a>
Philostratos, however, says that the Spartans allowed both
biting and gouging, but that the Eleans allowed only strangling. A
case of gouging the eye of an opponent with the thumb is seen on the
r.-f. kylix in the British Museum, already mentioned (Fig. <a href="#f55">55</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1738"></a><a href="#Footnote_1738" class="fnanchor">1738</a> Here
the official is rushing up with his rod to punish such a breach of the
rules. Philostratos calls the men’s pankration the “fairest” of contests
at Olympia, probably in reference to the impression made on the spectators
by the various positions of the contestants, who had to rely quite
as much on skill as on strength. Pindar wrote eight odes in praise
of this contest.<a id="FNanchor_1739"></a><a href="#Footnote_1739" class="fnanchor">1739</a> However, even though it was carefully regulated
at Olympia by rules, it was a dangerous sport—τὸ δεινὸν ἄεθλον ὅ
παγκράτιον καλέουσιν, in the words of the protesting philosopher Xenophanes.<a id="FNanchor_1740"></a><a href="#Footnote_1740" class="fnanchor">1740</a>
But it was never the brutal sport which some modern writers
have pictured it.<a id="FNanchor_1741"></a><a href="#Footnote_1741" class="fnanchor">1741</a> Plato, to be sure, kept it out of his ideal State,<a id="FNanchor_1742"></a><a href="#Footnote_1742" class="fnanchor">1742</a>
not, however, because of its brutality, but merely because its distinctive
feature, the struggle on the ground, was of no service in training
a soldier. The Greeks themselves considered the boxing match far
more dangerous. Inasmuch as gloves were not used in the pankration,
this seems reasonable.<a id="FNanchor_1743"></a><a href="#Footnote_1743" class="fnanchor">1743</a> We have in the preceding section men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>tioned
the epithets applied to boxing. Pausanias, in speaking of the
boxing match between Theagenes and Euthymos, says that the former
was too much wearied by that contest to enter the pankration, and was
in consequence compelled to pay a talent to the god and another to
Euthymos.<a id="FNanchor_1744"></a><a href="#Footnote_1744" class="fnanchor">1744</a> In speaking of another contest, between Kapros and
Kleitomachos, he records that the latter told the umpires that the
pankration should be brought on before he had received hurts from
boxing.<a id="FNanchor_1745"></a><a href="#Footnote_1745" class="fnanchor">1745</a> Artemidoros states that no wounds resulted from the
pankration.<a id="FNanchor_1746"></a><a href="#Footnote_1746" class="fnanchor">1746</a> However, death by strangulation was often the result of
the bout. Thus the pancratiast Arrhachion was crowned after he had
been throttled by his adversary, for just before expiring he was able
to put one of the toes of his opponent out of joint and the pain
caused the latter to let go his grip.<a id="FNanchor_1747"></a><a href="#Footnote_1747" class="fnanchor">1747</a> Pausanias tells also how the
boxer Kreugas was slain by Damoxenos in the pankration at Nemea,
but adds that the body of the former was proclaimed victor.<a id="FNanchor_1748"></a><a href="#Footnote_1748" class="fnanchor">1748</a></p>

<p>The pankration was not known to Homer, though later writers ascribed
its invention either to Theseus or Herakles, the typical mythical
examples of skill as opposed to brute force.<a id="FNanchor_1749"></a><a href="#Footnote_1749" class="fnanchor">1749</a> It was introduced at
Olympia in Ol. 33 (&#8239;=&#8239;648 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>),<a id="FNanchor_1750"></a><a href="#Footnote_1750" class="fnanchor">1750</a> long after the separate events, wrestling
and boxing, had appeared there. The boys’ contest was instituted
at Olympia in Ol. 145 (&#8239;=&#8239;200 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>),<a id="FNanchor_1751"></a><a href="#Footnote_1751" class="fnanchor">1751</a> though it had appeared
elsewhere much earlier.<a id="FNanchor_1752"></a><a href="#Footnote_1752" class="fnanchor">1752</a> It must have been a popular sport at
Olympia, since Pausanias records statues erected to twenty victors
for thirty victories in this contest.</p>

<p>Vase-paintings<a id="FNanchor_1753"></a><a href="#Footnote_1753" class="fnanchor">1753</a> show many grips and throws of the pankration—the
flying mare, leg hold,<a id="FNanchor_1754"></a><a href="#Footnote_1754" class="fnanchor">1754</a> tilting backwards by holding the antagonist’s
foot, “chancery” (<i>i. e.</i>  catching the adversary around the neck
with one arm and hitting his face with the other fist), stomach throw
(<i>i. e.</i>, seizing the adversary by the arms or shoulders and at the same time
planting one’s foot in the other’s stomach, and then throwing him over
one’s head),<a id="FNanchor_1755"></a><a href="#Footnote_1755" class="fnanchor">1755</a> jumping on the back of one’s opponent,<a id="FNanchor_1756"></a><a href="#Footnote_1756" class="fnanchor">1756</a> strangling,
wrestling and boxing combined, and kicking and boxing combined.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
Ground wrestling is very commonly depicted on vases and especially
on gems, since such groups were adapted to oblong or oval spaces.<a id="FNanchor_1757"></a><a href="#Footnote_1757" class="fnanchor">1757</a>
We reproduce a pancratiast scene from a Panathenaic amphora of Kittos,
dating from the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, in the British Museum (Fig.
59).<a id="FNanchor_1758"></a><a href="#Footnote_1758" class="fnanchor">1758</a> This is a conventional representation of wrestling and boxing
combined. The pancratiast at the right of the group has rushed in
with his head down and has been caught around the neck by his adversary’s
arm, a hopeless position, from which he can not escape. The
latter is either about to complete the neck hold (if it be an actual case
of “chancery”), or perhaps to hit him with his right hand. A third
pancratiast is looking on from the extreme right, while a <i>paidotribes</i>,
switch in hand, appears at the left. The fight on the ground is well
depicted on the r.-f. kylix of the British Museum already discussed as
showing boxing scenes (Fig. <a href="#f55">55</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1759"></a><a href="#Footnote_1759" class="fnanchor">1759</a></p>

<p>We have but few representations of pancratiasts in sculpture. The
preliminary sparring—known as ἀκροχειρισμός<a id="FNanchor_1760"></a><a href="#Footnote_1760" class="fnanchor">1760</a>—must have characterized
the statue of the Sikyonian pancratiast Sostratos at Olympia by an
unknown sculptor, since Pausanias says that this victor was known as
ὁ ἀκροχερσίτης, explaining the epithet as that of one who gained his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
victories by seizing and bending his adversaries’ fingers, holding them
fast till he yielded.<a id="FNanchor_1761"></a><a href="#Footnote_1761" class="fnanchor">1761</a> Since a Delphian inscribed base<a id="FNanchor_1762"></a><a href="#Footnote_1762" class="fnanchor">1762</a> gives the same
number of victories as Pausanias, we infer that they were given also
on the Olympia base, the source of Pausanias’ information. Since
nothing is said, however, of Sostratos’ mode of fighting in the Delphi
inscription, Pausanias must have argued it from the pose of the statue.
The Sicilian wrestler Leontiskos of a century earlier, whose statue was
by Pythagoras, had, according to Pausanias, used similar tactics, for
“he vanquished his adversaries by bending back their fingers.”<a id="FNanchor_1763"></a><a href="#Footnote_1763" class="fnanchor">1763</a> These
cases show that statues of pancratiasts and wrestlers were frequently
represented in vigorous lunging attitudes as well as in groups. The
epigram on the base of the monument of the pancratiast Teisikrates
at Delphi shows that the statue was represented in a similar way.<a id="FNanchor_1764"></a><a href="#Footnote_1764" class="fnanchor">1764</a>
The same lunging attitude is also shown on the Halimous grave-relief.<a id="FNanchor_1765"></a><a href="#Footnote_1765" class="fnanchor">1765</a>
Sometimes the contest ended with the preliminary sparring, though
usually it developed into wrestling and boxing.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 60.</span>—Bronze Statuette of a Pancratiast (?),
from Autun, France. Louvre, Paris.</div>
</div>

<p>A good representation of a pancratiast trying to kick his antagonist
seems to be furnished by the small bronze statuette from Autun, South
France, now in the Louvre (Fig. <a href="#f60">60</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1766"></a><a href="#Footnote_1766" class="fnanchor">1766</a> This statuette is of mediocre
workmanship, its hard muscles, imperfect proportions, and realism
showing that it comes from the Hellenistic period of Greek art. It
represents a bearded athlete, who holds his hands ready to strike and
his left foot raised apparently to kick his adversary’s leg. The foot is
just ready to return to its original position, so that the motive of this
poor little statuette discloses a transient period of time between two
movements, just as the <i>Diskobolos</i> and <i>Marsyas</i> of Myron did. We
have already noted<a id="FNanchor_1767"></a><a href="#Footnote_1767" class="fnanchor">1767</a> that on the head is a cap with a ring in the
top, by which it could be suspended as a decorative piece, or perhaps
as part of a steelyard. Hauser believes that this motive was
known to the elder Polykleitos and that this is the interpretation
of that sculptor’s statue of a <i>nudus talo incessens</i> mentioned by
Pliny, a statue which has formed the basis for much discussion
among archæologists.<a id="FNanchor_1768"></a><a href="#Footnote_1768" class="fnanchor">1768</a> The Plinian passage, therefore, is to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
translated as “the nude man attacking with his heel (<i>talo</i>)”—in other
words, it describes a statue represented as kicking, which was allowable
in the pankration. The manuscripts of Pliny all read <i>talo</i>, which
Benndorf<a id="FNanchor_1769"></a><a href="#Footnote_1769" class="fnanchor">1769</a> thought could be retained only by assuming that the naturalist
mistranslated his Greek source γυμνὸς ἀστραγάλῳ ἐπικείμενος,
translating the word ἐπικείμενος “standing upon,” as <i>incessens</i> “pursuing.”
He therefore assumed that Polykleitos’ statue stood upon an
astragalos (<i>talus</i>) basis, which he believed was the forerunner of the
statue of <i>Opportunity</i> (Καιρός) by Lysippos,<a id="FNanchor_1770"></a><a href="#Footnote_1770" class="fnanchor">1770</a> and he referred it to the
knuckle-bone basis found at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_1771"></a><a href="#Footnote_1771" class="fnanchor">1771</a> Woelfflin,<a id="FNanchor_1772"></a><a href="#Footnote_1772" class="fnanchor">1772</a> however, has shown
that <i>talo incessens</i> can only mean “<i>mit einem Knochel nach Jemand
einwerfen</i>.” Following this, Furtwaengler showed<a id="FNanchor_1773"></a><a href="#Footnote_1773" class="fnanchor">1773</a> how impossible on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
grammatical and other grounds it was to read <i>talo</i> in Benndorf’s sense,
since the passage then would mean “advancing towards” or “pursuing,”
by means of a knuckle-bone, which is manifestly nonsense. The word
could be only instrumental in use, as Woefflin said, <i>i. e.</i>, the weapon
by means of which the man was attacking. Furtwaengler, therefore,
followed Benndorf’s earlier alternative reading <i>telo</i>, assuming that
Pliny mistakenly wrote <i>talo</i> because he was influenced by the presence
of the same word in the passage immediately following: <i>duosque pueros
item nudos talis ludentes qui vocantur astragalizontes</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1774"></a><a href="#Footnote_1774" class="fnanchor">1774</a> But Hauser’s
interpretation of <i>talo</i> meets all the conditions better, since it keeps the
manuscript readings, makes grammatical Latin, and seems to be illustrated
by the statuette in question.</p>

<p>Sometimes the statues of Olympic pancratiasts were represented at
rest with the weight of the body equally on both legs, as we see from the
recovered basis of the statue of the Athenian Kallias by the Athenian
sculptor Mikon.<a id="FNanchor_1775"></a><a href="#Footnote_1775" class="fnanchor">1775</a> Furtwaengler has identified a statue in the Somzée
Collection as a copy of this work.<a id="FNanchor_1776"></a><a href="#Footnote_1776" class="fnanchor">1776</a> The footprints on the recovered base
of the statue of the Rhodian Dorieus show that it was represented at
rest with one leg slightly advanced.<a id="FNanchor_1777"></a><a href="#Footnote_1777" class="fnanchor">1777</a> We have actual remnants of
statues of Olympic pancratiasts in the marble head found at Olympia,
which we are to assign to the statue of the Akarnanian Philandridas by
Lysippos, mentioned by Pausanias (Frontispiece and Fig. <a href="#f69">69</a>),<a id="FNanchor_1778"></a><a href="#Footnote_1778" class="fnanchor">1778</a> and the
beautiful statue of Agias discovered by the French at Delphi in 1894,
a work by the same sculptor (Pl. <a href="#p28">28</a> and Fig. <a href="#f68">68</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1779"></a><a href="#Footnote_1779" class="fnanchor">1779</a></p>

<p>The struggle on the ground implies groups and not single statues.
Our best representation of such a group is furnished by the famous
marble one in the Uffizi, Florence (Pl. <a href="#p25">25</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1780"></a><a href="#Footnote_1780" class="fnanchor">1780</a> Though having no pretensions
to be a victor monument, this group is the most important
monument extant connected with the pankration, a fine anatomical
study from Hellenistic times, evincing the direct influence of Lysippos<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
in its proportions.<a id="FNanchor_1781"></a><a href="#Footnote_1781" class="fnanchor">1781</a> It shows affinity of design to certain sculptures
from the frieze of the Great Altar at Pergamon.<a id="FNanchor_1782"></a><a href="#Footnote_1782" class="fnanchor">1782</a> Pliny speaks of a
<i>symplegma</i> by Kephisodotos, the son of Praxiteles, at Pergamon, but
that group was of an erotic character and can not have had anything to
do with the Florentine one.<a id="FNanchor_1783"></a><a href="#Footnote_1783" class="fnanchor">1783</a> Unfortunately the group in question has
been much restored, though the restoration in the main is right. The
heads, though probably antique, do not seem to belong to the statues,
but both appear to be copies of the head of one of the Niobids, with
which group the pancratiasts were discovered in 1583. The right arm
of the uppermost athlete seems to have been wrongly restored; in any
case this athlete is not strangling his opponent. One youth has thrown
the other down on to his knee, and his left leg is intertwined with the
left leg of the other, and he is drawing back his arm to aim a blow. The
wrestler underneath supports himself upon his left arm, and the intention
of his opponent is to destroy this support by a blow of the fist,
which would bring the contest to a sudden conclusion, since the right
arm of the under youth is fast and he must defend himself with the
left. As Gardiner points out, such a situation is illustrated by Heliodoros’
description of the match between Theagenes and an Aethiopian
champion.<a id="FNanchor_1784"></a><a href="#Footnote_1784" class="fnanchor">1784</a> The under man’s position, however, may suddenly change
and the issue yet be in his favor. Many writers have explained the
group as ordinary wrestlers,<a id="FNanchor_1785"></a><a href="#Footnote_1785" class="fnanchor">1785</a> but Gardiner has conclusively shown
that it belongs to the pankration, since in wrestling the contest is ended
when one of the contestants has been thrown, while here the struggle
is continuing on the ground.<a id="FNanchor_1786"></a><a href="#Footnote_1786" class="fnanchor">1786</a></p>

<p>Kapros of Elis was the first of seven Olympic victors to emulate the
fabled feat of Herakles by winning the pankration and wrestling
matches on the same day—that is, he was the first professional strong
man.<a id="FNanchor_1787"></a><a href="#Footnote_1787" class="fnanchor">1787</a> The other six all came from the East. It has been suggested<a id="FNanchor_1788"></a><a href="#Footnote_1788" class="fnanchor">1788</a>
that the colossal <i>Farnese Herakles</i> found in Rome in the ruins of the
Baths of Caracalla in 1540 and now in Naples, inscribed as the work of
the Athenian Glykon, which represents the hero leaning wearily on his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>club against a rock,<a id="FNanchor_1789"></a><a href="#Footnote_1789" class="fnanchor">1789</a> may represent the type of these professional strong
men, who called themselves the successors of Herakles. But such
a suggestion is as unfounded as the one already examined, which identifies
the original of the <i>Seated Boxer</i> of the Museo delle Terme (Pl.
<a href="#p16">16</a> and Fig. <a href="#f27">27</a>) with Kleitomachos of Thebes, the redoubtable opponent
of Kapros, since the dates in both cases are against such identifications.
The Farnese statue and other replicas of the same original<a id="FNanchor_1790"></a><a href="#Footnote_1790" class="fnanchor">1790</a>
obviously revert to a Lysippan original, though they are considerably
metamorphosed by the taste of a later age. Such big swollen muscles
at first sight appear to be alien to the sculptor of the graceful <i>Agias</i>,
but that the Naples copy by Glykon—who, from the inscription on the
base, must be referred to the first century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_1791"></a><a href="#Footnote_1791" class="fnanchor">1791</a>—really represents the
work of Lysippos seems well established by the fact that a smaller copy,
though still over life-size, of poorer workmanship, in the Pitti Gallery
in Florence, is inscribed as Λυσίππου ἔργον.<a id="FNanchor_1792"></a><a href="#Footnote_1792" class="fnanchor">1792</a> This type of weary hero
appears in the <i>Telephos</i> group on the small Pergamene frieze, but is
even earlier, since the latter seems to have been borrowed from a statue
which is reproduced on a coin of Alexander, which was struck at least as
early as 300 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_1793"></a><a href="#Footnote_1793" class="fnanchor">1793</a> The type of Herakles wearied by his superhuman
labors was inaugurated still earlier by Lysippos, who was fond of representing
the hero in many poses, seated and standing, resting and laboring.
We might mention his colossal bronze statue of Herakles, which
was set up in Tarentum and then carried to Rome and placed on the
Capitol by Q. Fabius Maximus, when Tarentum was captured in 209
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, and was later transferred to the Hippodrome at Constantinople,
where it remained until the sack of that city by the Franks in
1202.<a id="FNanchor_1794"></a><a href="#Footnote_1794" class="fnanchor">1794</a> It is hazardous, therefore, to reject the evidence, and it will be
best to see in the original a genuine Lysippan work, as do Bulle, Overbeck,
von Mach, Schnaase,<a id="FNanchor_1795"></a><a href="#Footnote_1795" class="fnanchor">1795</a> and others, and so to make Glykon responsible
only for the exaggerations of his own copy. Thus we have to face
the fact of divergent styles in the great bronze founder of the fourth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, even if we admit with Richardson that “for our peace of
mind this statue might well have been sunk in the sea.”<a id="FNanchor_1796"></a><a href="#Footnote_1796" class="fnanchor">1796</a></p>

pancratiast found at Olympia, now in the Athens Museum (Figs. 61A
and B),<a id="FNanchor_1797"></a><a href="#Footnote_1797" class="fnanchor">1797</a> to one of two statues of the pancratiast Kapros mentioned
by Pausanias.<a id="FNanchor_1798"></a><a href="#Footnote_1798" class="fnanchor">1798</a> The remnant of a wild-olive crown in the hair proves
that it comes from the statue of an Olympic victor. Its bruised appearance
may, however, betoken the punishment administered by the
gloves of a boxer rather than by the bare fists of a pancratiast. That
Greek sculpture was not always ideal we have seen from the description
of the <i>Seated Boxer</i> of the Museo delle Terme (Pl. <a href="#p16">16</a> and Fig. <a href="#f27">27</a>).
This peculiarly life-like head is another example of the same realism; it
would be hard to name a more brutal and repellent piece from the whole
range of Greek sculpture. The profession of this bruiser is evident in
every feature, for the sculptor has betrayed it by the swollen ears, flat
nose, thick neck, swollen cheeks, projecting under lip, frowning brows,
and unkempt hair and beard. All these traits—especially the treatment
of the eyes—give to it the sullen gloomy look so characteristic
of boxers and pancratiasts.<a id="FNanchor_1799"></a><a href="#Footnote_1799" class="fnanchor">1799</a> The man appears to be awaiting the attack,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
his contracted brows showing alert expectation, and his closed lips great
determination. Furtwaengler, Bulle, Flasch, and others have dated
it in the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, and are fain to see in it the work of
an artist of the immediate circle of Lysippos or Lysistratos;<a id="FNanchor_1800"></a><a href="#Footnote_1800" class="fnanchor">1800</a> but its
exaggerated realism seems rather to point to a later period, not earlier
than the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_1801"></a><a href="#Footnote_1801" class="fnanchor">1801</a> The bronze foot of a victor statue also
found at Olympia (Fig. <a href="#f62">62</a>)<a id="FNanchor_1802"></a><a href="#Footnote_1802" class="fnanchor">1802</a> has been assigned by Furtwaengler to one of
the statues of Kapros, an ascription which we also have followed.<a id="FNanchor_1803"></a><a href="#Footnote_1803" class="fnanchor">1803</a> The
position of this foot shows—as an experiment with a living model has
disclosed—great movement, which makes it obvious that it comes from
a statue in lively motion, probably of a boxer or pancratiast. It belongs
to the statue of a strong man of coarse build; there is not the slightest
trace of unnecessary flesh on it, but the whole is vigorous muscle, even
the swollen veins being clearly visible in the photograph. While Furtwaengler
finds its stylistic parallels in the copies of the Pergamene
works of the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, <i>e. g.</i>, the <i>Dying Gaul</i> statues, the
material and form of the base fitting that period, Wolters emphasizes
its stylistic analogy to the bronze head just discussed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>MONUMENTS OF HIPPODROME AND MUSICAL
VICTORS.</small></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plates 26–27 and Figures 63–67.</span></p>

<p>In the preceding chapters we have considered the monuments of
victors in various gymnic contests, in which the victor won by his own
strength and skill. In the present chapter we shall be concerned
chiefly with the monuments set up by victors at Olympia in chariot-
and horse-races, in which the victory did not depend upon the athletic
prowess of the victor, but upon the skill of his charioteer or jockey and
the endurance of his horses.<a id="FNanchor_1804"></a><a href="#Footnote_1804" class="fnanchor">1804</a> Though such events were not in the
strict sense a part of Greek athletics, they formed a very important
feature of the festival at Olympia as elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_1805"></a><a href="#Footnote_1805" class="fnanchor">1805</a> Indeed the four-horse
chariot-race was the most spectacular and brilliant event at Olympia.
Chariot-races, and to a less extent horse-races, were the sport only of
the rich—kings, princes, and nobles.<a id="FNanchor_1806"></a><a href="#Footnote_1806" class="fnanchor">1806</a> Thus victories were won in these
events at Olympia in the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> by Hiero and Gelo, kings
of Syracuse, and Arkesilas IV of Kyrene; in the fourth, by Philip II
of Macedonia, and in Roman days by Tiberius, Germanicus, Nero, and
many others. Alkibiades in Ol. 91 (&#8239;=&#8239;416 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), <i>i. e.</i>, in the midst of the
great Peloponnesian war, entered seven chariots at Olympia and won
three prizes.<a id="FNanchor_1807"></a><a href="#Footnote_1807" class="fnanchor">1807</a> Sometimes a city entered a chariot or horse. Thus in
Ol. 77 (&#8239;=&#8239;472 <i>B.&nbsp;C.</i>) the public chariot of Argos, and in Ol. 75 (&#8239;=&#8239;480
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>) the public horse of the same city, won at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_1808"></a><a href="#Footnote_1808" class="fnanchor">1808</a> Such entries
show not only the expense attending these contests, but also their
importance in the eyes of the Greeks.</p>

<p>Hippodromes, chariot-races, and horse-races were very common in
Greece. A votive inscription in the museum at Sparta, dating from
near the middle of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, enumerates sixty victories by
Damonon and his son Enymakratidas in both chariot- and horse-races
at eight different meets in or near Lakonia, and Damonon was merely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
a local victor, unknown at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_1809"></a><a href="#Footnote_1809" class="fnanchor">1809</a> Greeks of Sicily and Magna
Græcia were especially fond of such contests, as we see these constantly
represented on coins of different cities there from the beginning of the
fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> on.<a id="FNanchor_1810"></a><a href="#Footnote_1810" class="fnanchor">1810</a> However, only a few of the sites of these many
hippodromes are now known, and only one can be positively identified,
that mentioned by Pausanias on Mount Lykaios in Arkadia.<a id="FNanchor_1811"></a><a href="#Footnote_1811" class="fnanchor">1811</a>
The others are known from literary sources.<a id="FNanchor_1812"></a><a href="#Footnote_1812" class="fnanchor">1812</a> The one at Olympia was
destroyed in the course of centuries by the floods of the Alpheios, and its
exact location can not be determined, though we know in general that it
lay somewhere southeast of the Altis, between the river and the Stadion,
and surmise that it ran somewhat parallel to the latter.<a id="FNanchor_1813"></a><a href="#Footnote_1813" class="fnanchor">1813</a></p>

<p>Its measurements, however, are known to us from a Greek metrological
parchment manuscript in the old Seraglio, Constantinople, which
dates from the eleventh century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span><a id="FNanchor_1814"></a><a href="#Footnote_1814" class="fnanchor">1814</a> According to it the length of the
course, <i>i. e.</i>, from the starting-point to turning-post and return, was
about 8 stades (1538 meters, 16 centimeters) or nearly 1 mile. One of
the two sides—which Pausanias says were of unequal length<a id="FNanchor_1815"></a><a href="#Footnote_1815" class="fnanchor">1815</a>—was 3
stades and 1 plethron long. The breadth of the course at the starting-point
was 1 stade and 4 plethra. We are told, however, that only a
portion of the entire course, six stades, or about two-thirds of a mile,
was traversed in the various races.</p>

<p>The oldest literary account of a Greek chariot-race is found in Homer
in the description of the games of Patroklos—the longest and finest
episode there described.<a id="FNanchor_1816"></a><a href="#Footnote_1816" class="fnanchor">1816</a> But the first trace of such a contest goes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>
back to mythology, to the story of Pelops and Oinomaos contending
for the hand of the latter’s daughter Hippodameia.<a id="FNanchor_1817"></a><a href="#Footnote_1817" class="fnanchor">1817</a> This mythical
race began at the village of Pisa in Elis and ended at the altar of
Poseidon on the Isthmus of Corinth.<a id="FNanchor_1818"></a><a href="#Footnote_1818" class="fnanchor">1818</a> The chariot-race was the chief
if not the only event at the oldest funeral games in Greece, those mentioned
by Pausanias as held in honor of Azan, the son of Arkas, in
Arkadia.<a id="FNanchor_1819"></a><a href="#Footnote_1819" class="fnanchor">1819</a> It figured largely in mythology<a id="FNanchor_1820"></a><a href="#Footnote_1820" class="fnanchor">1820</a> and was represented in
many works of art.<a id="FNanchor_1821"></a><a href="#Footnote_1821" class="fnanchor">1821</a> At Olympia it was one of the earliest, and perhaps
the earliest, of the events. Pausanias says that the four-horse chariot-race
was introduced there in Ol. 25 (&#8239;=&#8239;680 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>),<a id="FNanchor_1822"></a><a href="#Footnote_1822" class="fnanchor">1822</a> but this may merely
mean, as Gardiner points out, the date of exchanging the older prehistoric
two-horse chariot for the one drawn by four horses. In any case
the antiquity of the race at Olympia is shown by the great number of
early votive offerings in the form of models of chariots and horses,
which have been found there in a stratum extending below the foundations
of the Heraion.</p>

<h3>PROGRAMME OF HIPPODROME EVENTS.</h3>

<p>By the middle of the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> the fully developed programme
of equestrian events at Olympia and elsewhere consisted of six
races, three for full-grown horses (τέλειοι), and three for colts (πῶλοι);
for each of these two classes there were a four-horse chariot-race (ἅρμα,
τέθριππον), a two-horse chariot-race (συνωρίς), and a horse-race (κέλης),
thus:</p>

<p class="center">
ἅρματι τελείῳ, συνωρίδι τελείᾳ, κέλητι τελείῳ.<br />
ἅρματι πωλικῷ, συνωρίδι πωλικῇ, κέλητι πωλικῷ.
</p>

<p>These six events comprised the ἀγὼν ἱππικός at Olympia, Delphi,
Nemea, Corinth, Athens, and elsewhere, as opposed to the ἀγὼν γυμνικός.<a id="FNanchor_1823"></a><a href="#Footnote_1823" class="fnanchor">1823</a>
The distinction between horses and colts was apparently a matter which
was decided by the Hellanodikai at Olympia. Thus, Pausanias
recounts how the Spartan victor Lykidas entered a pair of colts for
the chariot-race, and that one of them was rejected by the judges;
he thereupon entered both for the race with full-grown horses and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
won it.<a id="FNanchor_1824"></a><a href="#Footnote_1824" class="fnanchor">1824</a> Though such a story does not fit the date of Lykidas, who
won before the colt-race was introduced at Olympia, it shows the
method of selection.<a id="FNanchor_1825"></a><a href="#Footnote_1825" class="fnanchor">1825</a> The race in which the chariot was drawn by
four full-grown horses (ἵππων τελείων δρόμος) was introduced, as we
have seen, in Ol. 25. The contestants drove twelve times round the
course, a distance of seventy-two stades or over eight miles.<a id="FNanchor_1826"></a><a href="#Footnote_1826" class="fnanchor">1826</a> Pausanias
mentions the monuments of eighteen such victors at Olympia
for nineteen victories. The race in which the chariot was drawn by
four colts (πώλων ἅρμα) was introduced in Ol. 99 (&#8239;=&#8239;384 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>),<a id="FNanchor_1827"></a><a href="#Footnote_1827" class="fnanchor">1827</a> and
extended eight times round the course, or about 5.5 miles.<a id="FNanchor_1828"></a><a href="#Footnote_1828" class="fnanchor">1828</a> Pausanias
mentions the monuments of only two such victors at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_1829"></a><a href="#Footnote_1829" class="fnanchor">1829</a>
The race in which the chariot was drawn by pairs of full-grown horses
(συνωρίς) was introduced in Ol. 93 (408 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>) and extended eight times
round the course.<a id="FNanchor_1830"></a><a href="#Footnote_1830" class="fnanchor">1830</a> Pausanias mentions but one victor in this event
at Olympia<a id="FNanchor_1831"></a><a href="#Footnote_1831" class="fnanchor">1831</a> and an Olympic victress who had a statue erected to
her in Sparta for such a victory.<a id="FNanchor_1832"></a><a href="#Footnote_1832" class="fnanchor">1832</a> This was probably the original
chariot-race at Olympia revived in Ol. 93, since the two-horse chariot
was the historical descendant of the Homeric war-chariot.<a id="FNanchor_1833"></a><a href="#Footnote_1833" class="fnanchor">1833</a> Panathenaic
vases show that this race existed at Athens in the sixth century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, side by side with the four-horse chariot-race and horseback-race.
The earliest of these vases, the so-called Burgon vase in the British
Museum,<a id="FNanchor_1834"></a><a href="#Footnote_1834" class="fnanchor">1834</a> was a prize there for this event. The race in which the
chariot was drawn by a pair of colts (συνωρὶς πώλων) was introduced
at Olympia in the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, in Ol. 129 (&#8239;=&#8239;264 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>),<a id="FNanchor_1835"></a><a href="#Footnote_1835" class="fnanchor">1835</a> and
extended three times around the course. Pausanias mentions no
monument erected to a victor in this race. The horse-race (ἵππος
κέλης) was instituted in Ol. 33 (&#8239;=&#8239;648 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>)<a id="FNanchor_1836"></a><a href="#Footnote_1836" class="fnanchor">1836</a>, and the foal-race (πῶλος
κέλης) nearly four centuries later, in Ol. 131 (256 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_1837"></a><a href="#Footnote_1837" class="fnanchor">1837</a> Neither of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
these races was known to Homer, for κελετίζειν in the Iliad,<a id="FNanchor_1838"></a><a href="#Footnote_1838" class="fnanchor">1838</a> as we
saw in Chapter I, refers only to the acrobatic feat of vaulting from
the back of one horse to that of another. Pausanias mentions monuments
erected to eight victors (for nine victories) in the regular horse-race
at Olympia. We conclude from a passage of his work<a id="FNanchor_1839"></a><a href="#Footnote_1839" class="fnanchor">1839</a> that
the riding-race consisted of one lap only or six stades, about two-thirds
of a mile. A mule chariot-race (ἀπήνη) was introduced in Ol.
70 (&#8239;=&#8239;500 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), and a trotting-race with mares (κάλπη) in Ol. 71
(&#8239;=&#8239;496 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), but both were abolished in Ol. 84 (&#8239;=&#8239;444 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_1840"></a><a href="#Footnote_1840" class="fnanchor">1840</a> Pausanias
mentions one monument erected to an anonymous victor in
κάλπη, who won some time between Ols. 72 and 84 (&#8239;=&#8239;492 and 444 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_1841"></a><a href="#Footnote_1841" class="fnanchor">1841</a>
He mentions the first victor in the mule-race, Thersias of Thessaly,
but this does not occur in his <i>periegesis</i> of the Altis.<a id="FNanchor_1842"></a><a href="#Footnote_1842" class="fnanchor">1842</a> Only three
other victors in this event are known to us, and they came from
Sicilian towns.<a id="FNanchor_1843"></a><a href="#Footnote_1843" class="fnanchor">1843</a></p>

<p>Equestrian events were discontinued at Olympia in the first century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, owing to the waning of interest in athletics in consequence of the
Roman conquest of Greece in 146 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> They were revived thereafter
under the Empire only spasmodically and were destined finally to be
replaced by the amusements of the Roman circus. Thus we learn from
the Armenian version of Africanus that the chariot-race ceased at
Olympia in Ol. 178 (&#8239;=&#8239;68 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>). It must, however, have been reinstated
toward the end of the century, since Tiberius Claudius Nero—afterwards
the Emperor Tiberius—won in Ol. 194 (&#8239;=&#8239;4 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_1844"></a><a href="#Footnote_1844" class="fnanchor">1844</a> It again
went into disuse, since Africanus says that it, πάλαι κωλυθείς, was reintroduced
in Ol. 199 (&#8239;=&#8239;17 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span>, when Germanicus, the adopted son
of Tiberius, won.<a id="FNanchor_1845"></a><a href="#Footnote_1845" class="fnanchor">1845</a> Once more it was discontinued, and again renewed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
in Ol. 222 (&#8239;=&#8239;109 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span>), according to the same authority, who, however,
does not name any victor for that date. Just when this discontinuance
took place, we can not say, but it was certainly after Ol. 211
(&#8239;=&#8239;65 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span>), when the emperor Nero is known to have won victories
in various kinds of chariot-races.<a id="FNanchor_1846"></a><a href="#Footnote_1846" class="fnanchor">1846</a> Three Olympiads before, an Elean,
Tiberios Klaudios Aphrodeisios, had also won the horse-race.<a id="FNanchor_1847"></a><a href="#Footnote_1847" class="fnanchor">1847</a></p>

<h3>REPRESENTATIONS OF THE CHARIOT-RACE.</h3>

<div class="figcenter500"><p class="right">PLATE 26</p><a id="p26"></a>
<img src="images/i_fp262.jpg" width="500" height="329" alt="Racing Chariot and Horses." />
<div class="caption">Racing Chariot and Horses. From an archaic b.-f. Hydria. Museum of Berlin.</div>
</div>

<p>Representations of the various chariot-races are commoner than
those of any other Olympic contest, appearing on vases, reliefs, coins,
and gems.<a id="FNanchor_1848"></a><a href="#Footnote_1848" class="fnanchor">1848</a> There seem to have been two distinct types of racing-chariot
in Greece.<a id="FNanchor_1849"></a><a href="#Footnote_1849" class="fnanchor">1849</a> The four-horse chariot was a modification of the
heroic two-horse war-chariot, which was a low car on two wheels, surmounted
by a box consisting of a high framework, open only at the
rear, and large enough to contain the chieftain and the charioteer.
The war-chariot was known to both Mycenæan Greece and Crete.
There is a relief of uncertain date in the Museum of Candia, which represents
a chariot and charioteer.<a id="FNanchor_1850"></a><a href="#Footnote_1850" class="fnanchor">1850</a> It is far superior to the type of chariots
appearing in relief on the gravestones found at Mycenæ,<a id="FNanchor_1851"></a><a href="#Footnote_1851" class="fnanchor">1851</a> though
the type on both is of the same general pattern, having the same box
and four-spoked wheels. On the Mycenæan reliefs the box seems to
rest directly upon the rim of the wheel, and the portrayal of a single
horse is very inartistic. On the Candia relief, however, there are at
least two horses discernible, and both the horses and the warrior, who
is about to mount the car, are lifelike. The Greek racing-car was much
lighter than the Homeric and Mycenæan war-chariot, and the box had
room only for the charioteer. It was drawn usually by four horses.
The Athenian type appears on Panathenaic vases throughout the whole
history of the manufacture of these vases,<a id="FNanchor_1852"></a><a href="#Footnote_1852" class="fnanchor">1852</a> and also on Macedonian
and Sicilian coins. On certain vases of later date the car is still lighter
and has larger wheels. One of the earliest racing-cars is seen on a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>vase in the British Museum,<a id="FNanchor_1853"></a><a href="#Footnote_1853" class="fnanchor">1853</a> dating from the eighth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> It
seems to be a two-horse car, as we should expect at this early date,
though the artist has drawn but one horse. The charioteer is clothed
in a long chiton, a custom which was generally kept throughout the
history of the chariot-race. The regular two-horse type of chariot
appears on vases as a cart, the body of the old war-chariot being so
diminished that nothing is left but the driver’s seat with a square open
framework on the sides. The driver rests his feet on a footboard suspended
from the pole.<a id="FNanchor_1854"></a><a href="#Footnote_1854" class="fnanchor">1854</a> Perhaps this represents a peculiarly Athenian
type of chariot, since the two-horse chariot on coins of Philip II, son of
Amyntas and father of Alexander the Great, a victor at Olympia in
both horse-racing and charioteering, resembles the ordinary four-horse
car, and the driver stands instead of sits.<a id="FNanchor_1855"></a><a href="#Footnote_1855" class="fnanchor">1855</a> The mule-car was like the
two-horse chariot, as we see in representations of it on coins of Rhegion
and Messana.<a id="FNanchor_1856"></a><a href="#Footnote_1856" class="fnanchor">1856</a> The best illustrations of racing with four-horse cars
are afforded by coins of Sicilian cities.<a id="FNanchor_1857"></a><a href="#Footnote_1857" class="fnanchor">1857</a> We see an excellent representation
of such a race on a sixth-century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> Panathenaic vase
recently found at Sparta, on which a chariot driven by a standing
charioteer is represented as passing a pillar on the right, and therefore
perhaps near the end of the race.<a id="FNanchor_1858"></a><a href="#Footnote_1858" class="fnanchor">1858</a> The harnessing of two horses to a
racing-car is seen on an archaic b.-f. hydria in Berlin (Pl. <a href="#p26">26</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1859"></a><a href="#Footnote_1859" class="fnanchor">1859</a> Here
a third horse appears, led by a nude youth, who is crowned, and who
therefore probably represents a victorious horse-racer. Several other
b.-f. vase-paintings showing four-horse chariots have been collected by
Gerhard.<a id="FNanchor_1860"></a><a href="#Footnote_1860" class="fnanchor">1860</a> However, we are not dependent upon vase-paintings and
coins to judge of the magnificence of Greek chariots of the historical
period, for we have actual remains of them—war-chariots, to be sure,
but not very unlike the ones used at the corresponding dates in Olympia.
Among these is the fine bronze <i>biga</i> found in the grave of an
Italian prince at Monteleone, Etruria, in 1902, and now one of the chief<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
treasures of the Metropolitan Museum in New York.<a id="FNanchor_1861"></a><a href="#Footnote_1861" class="fnanchor">1861</a> This is a war-chariot
of the beginning of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, the only complete
ancient bronze chariot now known. The restored frame of wood is
sheathed with thin bronze plates richly ornamented with reliefs
in repoussé. Because of its form and its relationship to chariots
appearing on archaic Ionic monuments of Asia Minor, for example,
on the reliefs of sarcophagi from Klazomenai, and because of the
strong resemblance between its decorative designs and those of
archaic Italian monuments of Ionicizing style, Furtwaengler has
classed it as the product of Ionic Greek art. Professor Chase, on
the other hand, finds these decorations pure Etruscan in character,
comparing them with the reliefs on three bronze tripods in the possession
of Mr. James Loeb, which are dated some half a century later.<a id="FNanchor_1862"></a><a href="#Footnote_1862" class="fnanchor">1862</a> In
any case this chariot is “<i>das glaenzendste, vollstaendigste</i>” archaic
metal work yet recovered. In the British Museum there are considerable
remnants of the chariot-group of King Mausolos and his wife
Artemisia, which once stood on the apex of the Mausoleion at Halikarnassos,
the work, according to Pliny,<a id="FNanchor_1863"></a><a href="#Footnote_1863" class="fnanchor">1863</a> of Pythis (or Pytheos), the architect
and historian of the tomb.<a id="FNanchor_1864"></a><a href="#Footnote_1864" class="fnanchor">1864</a> Besides the figures of the royal pair,
we have the head of one horse, the hinder half of another, fragments
of still others, and one wheel of the chariot.<a id="FNanchor_1865"></a><a href="#Footnote_1865" class="fnanchor">1865</a></p>

<h3>CHARIOT-GROUPS AT OLYMPIA.</h3>

<p>Great artists were engaged to set up chariot-groups at Olympia and
elsewhere. Many of the <i>quadrigae</i> and <i>bigae</i> mentioned by Pliny as
the works of sculptors and painters must have been agonistic offerings.<a id="FNanchor_1866"></a><a href="#Footnote_1866" class="fnanchor">1866</a>
Aeginetan sculptors were especially in favor at Olympia. Thus Onatas,
in conjunction with the Athenian Kalamis, made a group for King
Hiero,<a id="FNanchor_1867"></a><a href="#Footnote_1867" class="fnanchor">1867</a> and Glaukias made another for Hiero’s brother Gelo;<a id="FNanchor_1868"></a><a href="#Footnote_1868" class="fnanchor">1868</a> Simon
made an equestrian group for Phormis,<a id="FNanchor_1869"></a><a href="#Footnote_1869" class="fnanchor">1869</a> and Philotimos made a statue
for the horse-racer Xenombrotos of Kos.<a id="FNanchor_1870"></a><a href="#Footnote_1870" class="fnanchor">1870</a> The oldest dedication by
a chariot victor at Olympia was the votive offering of Miltiades, the
son of Kypselos, of Athens, which consisted of an ivory horn of Amal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>theia,
inscribed with archaic letters and set up in the treasury of the
Sikyonians. Miltiades won his victory in Ol. (?) 54 (&#8239;=&#8239;564 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_1871"></a><a href="#Footnote_1871" class="fnanchor">1871</a> The
next oldest dedication at Olympia was that of a chariot, without any
human figure, by the Spartan Euagoras, who won three victories in
Ols. (?) 58–60 (&#8239;=&#8239;548–540 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_1872"></a><a href="#Footnote_1872" class="fnanchor">1872</a> This custom of dedicating merely
the model of a chariot continued sporadically into the third century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> Thus Polypeithes of Sparta, who won a victory near the end of
the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>,<a id="FNanchor_1873"></a><a href="#Footnote_1873" class="fnanchor">1873</a> dedicated a chariot, while a figure of his
father, the wrestler Kalliteles, stood beside it.<a id="FNanchor_1874"></a><a href="#Footnote_1874" class="fnanchor">1874</a> A Pythian victor,
Arkesilas IV, son of Battos IV, king of Kyrene, who won a victory in
the 31st Pythiad (&#8239;=&#8239;462 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), dedicated a chariot at Delphi.<a id="FNanchor_1875"></a><a href="#Footnote_1875" class="fnanchor">1875</a> At the
beginning of the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> the Spartan princess Kyniska set
up “bronze horses less than life-size” in the pronaos of the temple of
Zeus at Olympia. The recovered base shows that Pausanias was right
about the size of this votive offering.<a id="FNanchor_1876"></a><a href="#Footnote_1876" class="fnanchor">1876</a> Theochrestos of Kyrene, who
won some time between Ols. (?) 100 and 122 (&#8239;=&#8239;380 and 292 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>),<a id="FNanchor_1877"></a><a href="#Footnote_1877" class="fnanchor">1877</a>
and Glaukon of Athens, who won in the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>,<a id="FNanchor_1878"></a><a href="#Footnote_1878" class="fnanchor">1878</a> also set up
votive chariots. The recovered base of Glaukon’s chariot shows that it
was small. Sometimes a chariot victor, for economy’s sake, contented
himself with dedicating merely a statue of himself in honor of his victory—a
custom which continued from the sixth to the third centuries
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> Perhaps one of the oldest examples of such a dedication of which
we have record is that of the Elean Archidamas, who won a victory at
an unknown date, but certainly some time after Ol. 66 (&#8239;=&#8239;515 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_1879"></a><a href="#Footnote_1879" class="fnanchor">1879</a>
In the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, the Spartans Anaxandros<a id="FNanchor_1880"></a><a href="#Footnote_1880" class="fnanchor">1880</a> and Lykinos<a id="FNanchor_1881"></a><a href="#Footnote_1881" class="fnanchor">1881</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
dedicated merely statues of themselves. In the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> the
Elean victors Timon,<a id="FNanchor_1882"></a><a href="#Footnote_1882" class="fnanchor">1882</a> whose monument was by Daidalos, Troilos,
whose monument was by Lysippos,<a id="FNanchor_1883"></a><a href="#Footnote_1883" class="fnanchor">1883</a> and Telemachos, whose statue
was by Philonides,<a id="FNanchor_1884"></a><a href="#Footnote_1884" class="fnanchor">1884</a> set up statues in honor of their victories. The
footprints on the inscribed base of the statue of Telemachos show that
he was represented standing at rest with both feet flat on the ground.
This was probably the position of the statues of the other two victors
mentioned. The statue of the Spartan victor Polykles, surnamed
<i>Polychalkos</i>, stood in a singular group. He was represented as being
greeted on his return home by his children, one of whom held a small
grace-hoop in his hand, while the other was trying to snatch the victor
ribbon from his father’s hand.<a id="FNanchor_1885"></a><a href="#Footnote_1885" class="fnanchor">1885</a> We learn from Diogenes Laertios that
the tyrant Periandros of Corinth vowed to set up a golden statue of
himself if he won the chariot-race.<a id="FNanchor_1886"></a><a href="#Footnote_1886" class="fnanchor">1886</a></p>

<p>The first instance chronologically recorded by Pausanias of a chariot
victor dedicating his statue along with chariot and horses is that of
king Gelo of Syracuse, the group being the work of the Aeginetan Glaukias.<a id="FNanchor_1887"></a><a href="#Footnote_1887" class="fnanchor">1887</a>
The first instance of a victor dedicating his statue in a group
with chariot, horses, and charioteer, is that of Kleosthenes of Epidamnos,
the group being the work of the Argive Hagelaïdas.<a id="FNanchor_1888"></a><a href="#Footnote_1888" class="fnanchor">1888</a> Even the names
of the horses were inscribed on this monument.<a id="FNanchor_1889"></a><a href="#Footnote_1889" class="fnanchor">1889</a> The owner of the
chariot, to be sure, took the prize, but he felt that the victory was due to
the horses and driver, and so he associated them with himself in the
monument. Sometimes the victor acted as his own charioteer. Thus
the Spartan Damonon, already mentioned as the hero of many chariot
victories in and near Sparta, tells in the inscription appearing on his
votive relief that he was his own charioteer.<a id="FNanchor_1890"></a><a href="#Footnote_1890" class="fnanchor">1890</a> In the first <i>Isthmian
Ode</i> Pindar congratulates Herodotos of Thebes, who won the chariot-race
(?) in 458 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, on not entrusting his chariot to strangers, but driving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
it himself.<a id="FNanchor_1891"></a><a href="#Footnote_1891" class="fnanchor">1891</a> Thrasyboulos seems to have driven his father’s car at the
victory commemorated by the sixth <i>Pythian Ode</i>, sung in honor of the
chariot victory of Xenokrates of Akragas in 490 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> at Delphi. Karrhotos,
the charioteer of Arkesilas of Kyrene already mentioned, was
the latter’s brother-in-law.<a id="FNanchor_1892"></a><a href="#Footnote_1892" class="fnanchor">1892</a> Similarly Aigyptos appears to have ridden
his own horse at Olympia instead of entrusting it to a jockey.<a id="FNanchor_1893"></a><a href="#Footnote_1893" class="fnanchor">1893</a> Sophokles,
in the <i>Electra</i>, has the hero Orestes drive his own chariot at the
<i>Pythia</i>. Kyniska, the daughter of king Archidamas of Sparta, was the
first woman to enter the contests at the race-course and the first to win
an Olympic victory with her chariot.<a id="FNanchor_1894"></a><a href="#Footnote_1894" class="fnanchor">1894</a> Apart from the small votive
offering, already mentioned as standing in the temple of Zeus, she had
also a victor-group at Olympia, by the sculptor Apellas, consisting of
chariot, horses, charioteer, and herself. The rounded form of the
recovered base,<a id="FNanchor_1895"></a><a href="#Footnote_1895" class="fnanchor">1895</a> in connection with the description of Pausanias, permits
us to assume that the statue of the princess stood in front on the
projecting rounded portion of the pedestal. This is the contention of
Loewy, who opposes the theory of Furtwaengler<a id="FNanchor_1896"></a><a href="#Footnote_1896" class="fnanchor">1896</a> that the statue stood
away from the rest of the group, since Pausanias makes no mention of
such an arrangement. In any case, the charioteer in the group can not
have been separated from the car.</p>

<p>In an unpublished paper by my former teacher, Dr. Alfred Emerson,
which was read by Professor D. M. Robinson before the Archæological
Institute of America at its Christmas meeting in Providence
in 1910, and entitled <i>The Case of Kyniska</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1897"></a><a href="#Footnote_1897" class="fnanchor">1897</a> the argument was made that
the chariot was in miniature; that the statue of Kyniska was a portrait,
because of the wording of the recovered epigram; and, lastly that
the smallest of the so-called bronze dancers from the villa of the Pisos
in Herculaneum, now in Naples, is a late reproduction of the statue at
Olympia by Apellas. Emerson thinks that Pliny no doubt often visited
the villa and may well have had these statues in mind when he mentioned
Apellas as the author of several statues of women adorning themselves.<a id="FNanchor_1898"></a><a href="#Footnote_1898" class="fnanchor">1898</a></p>

<p>The monument erected by Hiero, son of Deinomenes and brother
and successor of king Gelo at Syracuse, who won two horse-races and
a four-horse chariot victory at Olympia in Ols. 76, 77, 78 (&#8239;=&#8239;476–468
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>),<a id="FNanchor_1899"></a><a href="#Footnote_1899" class="fnanchor">1899</a> consisted of a bronze chariot, on which the charioteer was
mounted, and on either side a race-horse with a jockey on each. Onatas
made the chariot (and possibly the statue of the driver), while Kalamis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
sculptured the horses and jockeys. Such a division among sculptors
was not uncommon at Olympia. Thus the Aeginetan artist Simon and
the Argive Dionysios made a group in common for Phormis, which we
have already mentioned, consisting of two horses and two charioteers.<a id="FNanchor_1900"></a><a href="#Footnote_1900" class="fnanchor">1900</a>
The Chian Pantias and the Aeginetan Philotimos made a group in
common for Xenombrotos of Kos, victor in horse-racing, and for
his son, the boy boxer Xenodikos, which consisted of statues of the
man and the boy on horseback.<a id="FNanchor_1901"></a><a href="#Footnote_1901" class="fnanchor">1901</a> Pliny mentions a four-horse chariot-group
for which the elder Praxiteles made the charioteer and Kalamis
the chariot, adding that Praxiteles did this out of kindness, not wishing
it to be thought that Kalamis had failed in representing the man
after succeeding in representing the horses.<a id="FNanchor_1902"></a><a href="#Footnote_1902" class="fnanchor">1902</a></p>

<p>In some of the Olympic chariot-groups doubtless the charioteer was
represented at the moment of entering the chariot or already in it.
Sometimes a figure of Nike took the place of the charioteer, in order
that the victor’s exploit might be more exalted. Thus Pausanias, in
mentioning the bronze chariot of Kratisthenes of Kyrene by Pythagoras
of Rhegion,<a id="FNanchor_1903"></a><a href="#Footnote_1903" class="fnanchor">1903</a> says that statues of Nike and Kratisthenes himself
are mounted upon the car. The Nike in some cases was replaced by
the figure of a young maiden, who stood beside the victor, as in the
cases of the Elean Timon<a id="FNanchor_1904"></a><a href="#Footnote_1904" class="fnanchor">1904</a> and the Macedonian Lampos.<a id="FNanchor_1905"></a><a href="#Footnote_1905" class="fnanchor">1905</a> Pliny notes
a similar example in reference to the chariot of Teisikrates, a Delphian
victor in the two-horse chariot-race.<a id="FNanchor_1906"></a><a href="#Footnote_1906" class="fnanchor">1906</a> The maiden in all these cases
may have been merely a Nike personified or a mortal.<a id="FNanchor_1907"></a><a href="#Footnote_1907" class="fnanchor">1907</a> Pliny records
that the painter Nikomachos, son and pupil of Aristeides, painted a
<i>Victoria quadrigam in sublime rapiens</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1908"></a><a href="#Footnote_1908" class="fnanchor">1908</a> The figure of Nike appears
often on reliefs. Thus on a terra-cotta sarcophagus from Klazomenai
we see a two-horse chariot driven by a boy, while alongside is a winged
female figure—Iris or Nike—mounting it.<a id="FNanchor_1909"></a><a href="#Footnote_1909" class="fnanchor">1909</a> The moment of victory is
shown on an Attic marble votive relief representing a four-horse chariot,
now in the British Museum. Here a figure of Nike is represented as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
floating in the air and extending a wreath (now wanting) towards the
head of the charioteer, who is draped with a tunic girdled at the waist,
as he mounts the car. If the charioteer in this relief is a female (which
is doubtful), it may he the personification of the city to which the
winner belongs.<a id="FNanchor_1910"></a><a href="#Footnote_1910" class="fnanchor">1910</a> On a votive relief in Athens a horse is represented
as being crowned by Nike.<a id="FNanchor_1911"></a><a href="#Footnote_1911" class="fnanchor">1911</a> On a relief in Madrid Nike is represented as
driving a chariot.<a id="FNanchor_1912"></a><a href="#Footnote_1912" class="fnanchor">1912</a> A quadriga with a female figure, apparently Nike,
appears on a relief dedicated to Hermes and the Nymphs, which was
found in Phaleron.<a id="FNanchor_1913"></a><a href="#Footnote_1913" class="fnanchor">1913</a> Doubtless some of the chariot-groups at Olympia
represented movement—the start, the course, or the end of the race—as
do these and similar reliefs.<a id="FNanchor_1914"></a><a href="#Footnote_1914" class="fnanchor">1914</a> We should add that the figure of Nike
was not confined to equestrian monuments. On the Ficoroni cista in
Rome is represented the boxing match between Polydeukes and Amykos
among the Bebrykes. In the centre we see Amykos hanged to a tree by
the hands, while to the right stands Athena, and above her Nike is
flying with a crown and fillet of victory for Polydeukes.<a id="FNanchor_1915"></a><a href="#Footnote_1915" class="fnanchor">1915</a></p>

<h3>REMAINS OF CHARIOT-GROUPS.</h3>

<p>From this discussion of the literary evidence about the monuments
of chariot victors at Olympia and elsewhere, we shall turn to a brief
consideration of certain existing works of sculpture, reliefs and statues,
which will serve to illustrate the manner in which the sculptor represented
this class of victor monuments.</p>

<div class="figcenter400"><a id="f63"></a>
<img src="images/i_p270.jpg" width="400" height="491" alt="Charioteer Mounting a Chariot." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 63.</span>—Charioteer Mounting a Chariot. Bas-relief
from the Akropolis. Akropolis Museum, Athens.</div>
</div>

<p>The motive of representing a figure in the act of mounting a chariot
is old. Amphiaraos was thus represented on the chest of Kypselos at
Olympia<a id="FNanchor_1916"></a><a href="#Footnote_1916" class="fnanchor">1916</a> and appears in a similar pose on the b.-f. Corinthian vase from
Cerveteri, now in Berlin, which we have already mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_1917"></a><a href="#Footnote_1917" class="fnanchor">1917</a> Among
reliefs we shall first discuss the Parian (?) marble one found in 1822 near
the Propylaia at Athens and now in the Akropolis Museum (Fig. <a href="#f63">63</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1918"></a><a href="#Footnote_1918" class="fnanchor">1918</a>
Here we see represented a robed figure stepping into a chariot, holding
the reins in the extended hands. This Attic work, perhaps dating from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>
the very beginning of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, has long been admired for
its vigor and grace. Whether the figure is male or female, human or
divine, is still a matter of debate. The head is too badly weathered to
make the decision final. The upper part of the figure of Hermes (?)
on another fragment, which appears to come from the same relief and
which was found near the south wall of the Akropolis in 1859,<a id="FNanchor_1919"></a><a href="#Footnote_1919" class="fnanchor">1919</a> has
made it seem reasonable to call the charioteer a god, perhaps Apollo.<a id="FNanchor_1920"></a><a href="#Footnote_1920" class="fnanchor">1920</a>
The hair of Hermes and of the charioteer is arranged in the old
Attic <i>krobylos</i> fashion. This also makes it natural to interpret the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
charioteer as male, despite the slender and delicate arms and hands,
which appear to be female.<a id="FNanchor_1921"></a><a href="#Footnote_1921" class="fnanchor">1921</a> But such effeminate male figures are not
unknown to Attic art, which was characterized by grace and softness.<a id="FNanchor_1922"></a><a href="#Footnote_1922" class="fnanchor">1922</a>
The line of the breast, however, shows no such fulness as archaic
masters were wont to give to female forms, and hence this figure may
very well be that of a male. Schrader has tried to refer the slab to the
frieze of the Old Temple of Athena, which, he believes, survived the
sack of the Akropolis by Xerxes,<a id="FNanchor_1923"></a><a href="#Footnote_1923" class="fnanchor">1923</a> thus assuming a chariot-frieze
similar to the later one appearing on the Mausoleion at Halikarnassos,
which antedated similar scenes on the Parthenon frieze by nearly a century.
As the Parthenon slabs represent mortal charioteers, who are
doubtless males, the relief may also represent a mortal. However, the
Akropolis relief may have had nothing to do with any temple frieze nor
with the adornment of a great altar of Athena, as Furtwaengler contended,<a id="FNanchor_1924"></a><a href="#Footnote_1924" class="fnanchor">1924</a>
but may be from a votive monument set up by a chariot
victor.<a id="FNanchor_1925"></a><a href="#Footnote_1925" class="fnanchor">1925</a></p>

<p>We see a good representation in relief of a chariot-group on one side
of the arched roof of the so-called Chimæra tomb discovered by Sir
Charles Fellows at Xanthos in Lykia. Here is represented a chariot
drawn by four horses, in which stands a charioteer, with sleeved tunic
and Phrygian cap, and an armed figure. Because of the figure of the
Chimæra in the lower right-hand corner, the charioteer, despite the
absence of Pegasos, has been called Bellerophon.<a id="FNanchor_1926"></a><a href="#Footnote_1926" class="fnanchor">1926</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span></p>

<h3>THE APOBATES CHARIOT-RACE.</h3>

<p>On the north frieze of the Parthenon there were originally at least 9
four-horse chariot groups,<a id="FNanchor_1927"></a><a href="#Footnote_1927" class="fnanchor">1927</a> while on the south frieze there were 10 such
groups.<a id="FNanchor_1928"></a><a href="#Footnote_1928" class="fnanchor">1928</a> These various groups represent a ceremonial chariot-race
called the <i>apobates</i>, known at Athens and in Bœotia and a favorite
contest at the Panathenaic games.<a id="FNanchor_1929"></a><a href="#Footnote_1929" class="fnanchor">1929</a> This race preserved the tradition
of Homeric warfare, when the chieftain was driven to battle in his
chariot, but dismounted to fight, remounting only to pursue or avoid his
enemy. During the race, while the charioteer kept the horses at full
speed, the <i>apobates</i> dismounted, ran alongside the chariot, and mounted
again. In the last lap he dismounted and ran beside the chariot to
the goal.<a id="FNanchor_1930"></a><a href="#Footnote_1930" class="fnanchor">1930</a> In the North frieze we see the charioteer in the chariot,
and the <i>apobates</i>, armed with shield and helmet, either stepping down
from the chariot or standing beside it; while a third figure, a marshal,
stands nearby. Thus on slab XIV we see the <i>apobates</i> about to step
down; on slab XV he is standing up in the chariot; on slab XVII
(Fig. <a href="#f64">64</a>) he is leaning back, supporting himself by means of his right
hand, which grasps the chariot rail, and is just ready to step down; on slab
XXII he is remounting the chariot. In the scenes on the South frieze,
on the other hand, the <i>apobates</i> is not represented as dismounting,
but is standing either inside the chariot or by its side. The South
frieze, therefore, represents preparation or the beginning of the race,
while the North one represents the actual course. There is, therefore,
as Gardiner points out, no need to accept Michaelis’ theory that the
two friezes portray different motives, the North one representing the
<i>apobates</i> at the games and the South one representing war-chariots.
The double character of the race is shown by inscriptions which make
both charioteer and <i>apobates</i> equally victors. Many other reliefs show
the <i>apobates</i> dismounting. Thus, on a fragmentary relief found in 1886
at the Amphiareion at Oropos and now in Athens,<a id="FNanchor_1931"></a><a href="#Footnote_1931" class="fnanchor">1931</a> we see a nude and
beardless youth standing in a chariot, which is moving rapidly to the
left. He has a helmet on his head and a shield in his left hand and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
holds on to the rim of the chariot, as in the Parthenon frieze slab just
mentioned. To his right is a charioteer with his arms outstretched to
hold the reins. As this relief is obviously influenced by the Parthenon
frieze, it must stand midway between that frieze and the Hellenistic
relief to be described below. Another relief, found at Oropos in 1835<a id="FNanchor_1932"></a><a href="#Footnote_1932" class="fnanchor">1932</a>
and dating from the first half of the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, represents
a four-horse chariot moving to the left and containing two persons.
One is the charioteer, who has long waving hair and a short beard and
is clothed in the usual long tunic; the other is a nude <i>apobates</i>, who is
armed with helmet and shield and holds on to the rim of the chariot
with his right hand, the upper part of his body being inclined backwards,
the knees bent, and the shield held away from the body.<a id="FNanchor_1933"></a><a href="#Footnote_1933" class="fnanchor">1933</a> We
can not say whether these two reliefs from the Amphiareion represent
offerings of <i>apobatai</i>, who were victorious at races held in Oropos or
elsewhere in Bœotia, or represent the victorious Panathenaic <i>apobatai</i>.
They may well be <i>ex votos</i> to the hero Amphiaraos at the
games held in Oropos. We see an excellent illustration of an <i>apobates</i>
in the very act of dismounting on a Hellenistic votive relief discovered

suggests that it may represent an <i>apobates</i>, but the absence of the
usual armor makes it probable that a charioteer is intended. In
a future section we shall discuss the <i>apobates</i> in the horse-race at
Olympia known as κάλπη.</p>

<h3>STATUES OF CHARIOTEERS.</h3>

<p>The best-preserved slab from the small Parian marble chariot-frieze
from the Mausoleion of Halikarnassos, now in the British Museum,
represents a male figure standing in a chariot (Fig. <a href="#f65">65</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1936"></a><a href="#Footnote_1936" class="fnanchor">1936</a>
This long-haired
charioteer, dressed in a tunic which extends to the feet and is
girded at the waist, is leaning forward in an eager attitude. The folds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
of his garment curved to the wind show the speed of his horses, and the
mutilated face discloses a look of intense excitement. The deep-set
eyes and overhanging brows recall the Tegea heads of Skopas (Fig. <a href="#f73">73</a>)
and the combatants pictured on the so-called <i>Alexander Sarcophagus</i>
discovered near Sidon in 1887 and now in Constantinople.<a id="FNanchor_1937"></a><a href="#Footnote_1937" class="fnanchor">1937</a> The pose
is so characteristic and spirited that it was copied by later artists on
reliefs and gems.<a id="FNanchor_1938"></a><a href="#Footnote_1938" class="fnanchor">1938</a> The same pose, forward inclination of the body,
half-opened mouth, and intense look seem to be reproduced in a statue
of the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> now in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston
(Pl. <a href="#p27">27</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1939"></a><a href="#Footnote_1939" class="fnanchor">1939</a> Robinson, because of the similarity of its head to certain
heads of Apollo published by Overbeck,<a id="FNanchor_1940"></a><a href="#Footnote_1940" class="fnanchor">1940</a> interpreted this statue as
Apollo starting to run. Von Mach, however, has pointed out that its
head bears a more striking resemblance to that of a <i>Kore</i> in Vienna.<a id="FNanchor_1941"></a><a href="#Footnote_1941" class="fnanchor">1941</a>
Klein interpreted it as a jumper, assuming that the two supports on the
legs were for the wrists, indicating that the arms were held downwards,
the hands, then, holding <i>halteres</i>. But von Mach makes it clear that
these supports are not parallel, as Klein thought, but that they diverge
outwards and consequently may have made the connection with the
sides of a chariot rim. Furthermore, the likeness to the figure on the
Mausoleion frieze (Fig. <a href="#f65">65</a>) makes it probable that we are here concerned
with a charioteer. The objection to this theory on the ground of
nudity is baseless. Though the conventional garb of the charioteer in
Greek art from the eighth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> onwards<a id="FNanchor_1942"></a><a href="#Footnote_1942" class="fnanchor">1942</a> was certainly a long,
close-fitting chiton, there are several examples in existence of nude
charioteers.<a id="FNanchor_1943"></a><a href="#Footnote_1943" class="fnanchor">1943</a> Similarly the objection that the artificial head-dress does
not belong to a charioteer is equally erroneous. Klein has shown that it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
appears on several heads of boys, and, as von Mach says, it is certainly
no better suited to Apollo or a jumper than to a boy driving colts
in a chariot-race. The pose of the Boston statue also reminds us
somewhat of that of the small bronze statue of a boy found in the Rhine
near Xanten in 1858 and now in Berlin.<a id="FNanchor_1944"></a><a href="#Footnote_1944" class="fnanchor">1944</a> This is a Roman work seemingly
inspired by a Greek prototype, and has been interpreted variously as
the statue of <i>Bonus Eventus, Novus Annus</i>, and Dionysos. However,
here again the forward inclination of the body points to the interpretation
of a charioteer,<a id="FNanchor_1945"></a><a href="#Footnote_1945" class="fnanchor">1945</a> despite its nudity. The nude statue found
on the Esquiline in 1874 and now in the Palazzo dei Conservatori,
Rome, which has already been mentioned,<a id="FNanchor_1946"></a><a href="#Footnote_1946" class="fnanchor">1946</a> has been shown to be
that of a charioteer by a comparison with figures on Attic vases which
represent mortals and gods entering chariots, and with a figure on the
so-called <i>Satrap Sarcophagus</i> in Constantinople.<a id="FNanchor_1947"></a><a href="#Footnote_1947" class="fnanchor">1947</a> The youth is represented
as standing on his left foot; he places his right on the chariot
floor and extends his hands to hold the reins. The statue seems to be a
mediocre Roman copy of a Greek original bronze of about the middle
of the fifth century <i>B.&nbsp;C.</i>, as it shows certain traces of archaism. Furtwaengler
has assigned it to the sculptor Kalamis along with a closely
connected group of monuments.<a id="FNanchor_1948"></a><a href="#Footnote_1948" class="fnanchor">1948</a></p>

</div>

<p>Finally, in this connection, even though it has nothing to do with
monuments set up at Olympia, we shall discuss the life-size bronze
statue of the <i>Charioteer</i> discovered by the French in 1896 in the excavations
of Delphi, and now the cynosure of the village museum there.
(Fig. <a href="#f66">66</a>.)<a id="FNanchor_1949"></a><a href="#Footnote_1949" class="fnanchor">1949</a> This example of ripe archaic art is one of the finest
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>bronzes yet recovered in Greece. Its ancient fame is disclosed by the
fact that it was copied in many monuments down to the end of antiquity.<a id="FNanchor_1950"></a><a href="#Footnote_1950" class="fnanchor">1950</a>
The figure is clothed in a short-sleeved chiton, which reached
nearly to the ground, and is girded above the waist. With the figure
<span class="figright250"><a id="f66"></a>
<img src="images/i_p277.jpg" width="250" height="640" alt="Bronze Statue of the
Delphi Charioteer." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 66.</span>—Bronze Statue of the
Delphi <i>Charioteer</i>. Museum of Delphi.</span></span>
were found also fragments of reins,
which were held in the extended
right hand, portions of three horses,
a chariot pole, and the left arm and
hand of a second figure, that of a
boy or woman, showing that the
<i>Charioteer</i> was part of a group.
The group rested on a base on
which was cut a two-line metrical
inscription, the ends of which are
preserved. The first line ends
Πολύζαλός μ’ ἀνέθηκεν. A part of
the inscription is lost and another
part, including the above words, is
written over the erased original,
which is still partly legible. The
original inscription gives the name of
the first dedicator as ending in ιλας.
From this ending Professor Washburn
recovers the name Ἀρκεσίλας.
He refers the original dedication
to Arkesilas IV of Kyrene,<a id="FNanchor_1951"></a><a href="#Footnote_1951" class="fnanchor">1951</a> and
identifies it with the group known
from Pausanias to have been dedicated
at Delphi by the people of
Kyrene, representing Battos and
the figure of Libya crowning him
in a chariot and the charioteer personified
as Kyrene outside, the whole
being the work of the Knossian
sculptor Amphion.<a id="FNanchor_1952"></a><a href="#Footnote_1952" class="fnanchor">1952</a> Svoronos<a id="FNanchor_1953"></a><a href="#Footnote_1953" class="fnanchor">1953</a> follows
Washburn’s suggestion and
identifies the <i>Charioteer</i> with Battos,
believing that the fragment of
the left arm found with the statue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
is from the statue of Kyrene represented as a charioteer.<a id="FNanchor_1954"></a><a href="#Footnote_1954" class="fnanchor">1954</a> Ingenious
as the theory is, there are chronological difficulties in the way of
accepting it unreservedly. Thus Amphion’s pupil Pison worked on
the Spartan memorial of Aigospotamoi at Delphi in 404 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_1955"></a><a href="#Footnote_1955" class="fnanchor">1955</a> Furthermore,
the ending ιλας may equally well refer to Anaxilas, the tyrant
of Rhegion, as the original dedicator,<a id="FNanchor_1956"></a><a href="#Footnote_1956" class="fnanchor">1956</a> in which case it seems reasonable
to assume that the group might have been the work of Pythagoras,
the great sculptor of Rhegion.<a id="FNanchor_1957"></a><a href="#Footnote_1957" class="fnanchor">1957</a> A Greek scholar believes that
the original dedicator was Gelo, and that his name was erased and
replaced by that of his brother Polyzalos; he consequently dates the
group shortly after Gelo’s death in 478 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_1958"></a><a href="#Footnote_1958" class="fnanchor">1958</a> He refers it to Glaukias
of Aegina, while Joubin<a id="FNanchor_1959"></a><a href="#Footnote_1959" class="fnanchor">1959</a> classes the <i>Charioteer</i> as an Attic work.
However, the whole subject of Greek sculpture in the years just
after the Persian war period is too complicated to name definitely the
artist of this simple and severe work. Its deficiencies are as apparent
as its virtues. Thus the parallel folds of the chiton show little of
the form beneath; the feet are too flatly placed on the ground, and
the contour of the head and face is not altogether graceful.<a id="FNanchor_1960"></a><a href="#Footnote_1960" class="fnanchor">1960</a> Whatever
the original purpose of the group was, it may well have been
used by Polyzalos to honor the Pythian victory of his brother Hiero.<a id="FNanchor_1961"></a><a href="#Footnote_1961" class="fnanchor">1961</a>
From it, then, we can get, perhaps, an idea of the magnificence of
Hiero’s monument by Onatas and Kalamis at Olympia.</p>

<h3>DEDICATIONS OF VICTORS IN THE HORSE-RACE AT
OLYMPIA AND ELSEWHERE.</h3>

<p>The hippic victor at Olympia frequently dedicated merely the model
of his victorious horse without the jockey, just as the early chariot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>
victor dedicated a chariot without the charioteer. We have evidence of
several instances of this custom from the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> on. Krokon
of Eretria dedicated a small horse of bronze in the Altis.<a id="FNanchor_1962"></a><a href="#Footnote_1962" class="fnanchor">1962</a> The
Corinthian Pheidolas dedicated a model of his horse alone, but for a
different reason.<a id="FNanchor_1963"></a><a href="#Footnote_1963" class="fnanchor">1963</a> The jockey who rode for him fell off at the start,
but the mare, named <i>Aura</i>, continued the race and reached the goal as
victor. The owner was allowed by the judges to set up a monument to
her. The sons of Pheidolas were also victors in the horse-race<a id="FNanchor_1964"></a><a href="#Footnote_1964" class="fnanchor">1964</a> and set
up a horse on a column with an epigram upon it—ἵππος ἐπὶ στήλῃ
πεποιημένος καὶ ἐπίγραμμά ἐστιν ἐπ’ αὐτῷ. Just how this monument
looked is doubtful. Pausanias may have seen the bronze horse of the
father Pheidolas, and nearby a column with a bas-relief representing
the horse of the sons;<a id="FNanchor_1965"></a><a href="#Footnote_1965" class="fnanchor">1965</a> or the horse may have stood on top of the column
in the round, since the epigram was ἐπ’ αὐτῷ (on the horse) and not
ἐπ’ αὐτῇ (on the stele).<a id="FNanchor_1966"></a><a href="#Footnote_1966" class="fnanchor">1966</a></p>

<p>More frequently a jockey was seated upon the model of the horse,
just as we see frequently on vase-paintings. In the Olympic monument
of King Hiero already mentioned, race-horses with boys seated
upon them stood on either side of the chariot in honor of his two victories
in the horse-race and one in the chariot-race.<a id="FNanchor_1967"></a><a href="#Footnote_1967" class="fnanchor">1967</a> Another Olympia
group represented the boy horse-racer Aigyptos on horseback, and his
father, the chariot victor Timon, standing beside him.<a id="FNanchor_1968"></a><a href="#Footnote_1968" class="fnanchor">1968</a> This is also a
case in which the victor (Aigyptos) acted as his own jockey. In the
group representing Xenombrotos of Kos, the horse-racer, and his son,
the boy boxer Xenodikos, by the Aeginetan Philotimos and the Chian
Pantias respectively, the boy was seated on a horse and the statue of
the father stood nearby.<a id="FNanchor_1969"></a><a href="#Footnote_1969" class="fnanchor">1969</a> The base of this group has been recovered,
large enough to have carried the two monuments.<a id="FNanchor_1970"></a><a href="#Footnote_1970" class="fnanchor">1970</a> Pliny says that the
sculptors Kanachos and Hegias made groups of horse-racers.<a id="FNanchor_1971"></a><a href="#Footnote_1971" class="fnanchor">1971</a> We have
seen that Pausanias mentions others by Kalamis and Daidalos. The
work of Kalamis, the immediate predecessor of Pheidias, an artist
noted for his grace and softness and as an unrivaled sculptor of horses,<a id="FNanchor_1972"></a><a href="#Footnote_1972" class="fnanchor">1972</a>
must have been excellent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span></p>

<h3>MONUMENTS ILLUSTRATING THE HORSE-RACE.</h3>

<p>When we turn to the monuments which illustrate the horse-race, we
find as varied a number—vase-paintings, reliefs, coins, statuary, etc.—as
in the case of chariot victors.</p>

<div class="figcenter500"><a id="f67"></a>
<img src="images/i_p280.jpg" width="500" height="318" alt="Horse-Racer." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 67.</span>—Horse-Racer. From a Sixth-Century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> b.-f. Panathenaic Vase.
British Museum, London.</div>
</div>

<p>Vase-paintings show that the jockey was generally nude and rode
without stirrups or saddle. We see nude long-haired jockeys on
horseback with whips pictured on a sixth-century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> Panathenaic
amphora in the British Museum.<a id="FNanchor_1973"></a><a href="#Footnote_1973" class="fnanchor">1973</a> One also appears on a silver tetradrachm
in the same museum, which commemorates the Olympic
victory of Philip II of Macedonia.<a id="FNanchor_1974"></a><a href="#Footnote_1974" class="fnanchor">1974</a> Here the victorious mounted
jockey has a palm in his hand, the symbol of his victory. On the other
hand, the jockey is sometimes represented as wearing a close-fitting
short-sleeved chiton. We see such a one on an archaic b.-f. Panathenaic
vase of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> in the British Museum (Fig. <a href="#f67">67</a>).<a id="FNanchor_1975"></a><a href="#Footnote_1975" class="fnanchor">1975</a>
In front of the mounted youth on this vase stands a herald in official
robes, from whose mouth issue the words “the horse of Dyneiketos is
victorious.” Behind the jockey is an attendant bearing a wreath
in his left hand and holding a prize tripod over his head. The short
chiton also appears on a horse-racer on the Amphiaraos vase.<a id="FNanchor_1976"></a><a href="#Footnote_1976" class="fnanchor">1976</a> We see
racing boys on a proto-Corinthian lekythos in the museum at Taranto,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
with tripods as prizes.<a id="FNanchor_1977"></a><a href="#Footnote_1977" class="fnanchor">1977</a> A fine example of five nude horse-racers also
appears on a vase pictured in the Daremberg-Saglio Dictionary.<a id="FNanchor_1978"></a><a href="#Footnote_1978" class="fnanchor">1978</a> Here
one has fallen from his horse and is being dragged by the bridle.</p>

<p>A boy on a galloping horse is shown on a terra-cotta relief from Thera.<a id="FNanchor_1979"></a><a href="#Footnote_1979" class="fnanchor">1979</a>
On a funerary marble relief from Sicily, now in the Museo Gregoriano,
Rome, a rider is represented urging his horse on with a whip.<a id="FNanchor_1980"></a><a href="#Footnote_1980" class="fnanchor">1980</a> An
Athenian relief shows victorious ephebes leading horses,<a id="FNanchor_1981"></a><a href="#Footnote_1981" class="fnanchor">1981</a> while another
from Athens shows a mounted boy.<a id="FNanchor_1982"></a><a href="#Footnote_1982" class="fnanchor">1982</a> Horsemen representing Athenian
knights appear on many slabs of the Parthenon frieze,<a id="FNanchor_1983"></a><a href="#Footnote_1983" class="fnanchor">1983</a> either mounted
or standing by their horses.</p>

<p>The inscribed base of Onatas found on the Akropolis seems to have
borne the statue of a horse-racer.<a id="FNanchor_1984"></a><a href="#Footnote_1984" class="fnanchor">1984</a> The bronze statue of Isokrates at
Athens, which represented him as a παῖς κελητίζων, is mentioned by the
pseudo-Plutarch.<a id="FNanchor_1985"></a><a href="#Footnote_1985" class="fnanchor">1985</a> A bronze statuette in Athens from Dodona represents
an ephebe on a galloping horse.<a id="FNanchor_1986"></a><a href="#Footnote_1986" class="fnanchor">1986</a> A statue in the Palazzo Orlandi
in Florence represents a horse-rider.<a id="FNanchor_1987"></a><a href="#Footnote_1987" class="fnanchor">1987</a> In the Akropolis Museum
there are two monuments which we should mention in this connection.
One is the lower part of the statue of a nude rider on horseback, the
mutilated horse being represented as pawing the ground with its forefoot.
Closely resembling it in scale and finish, though more developed
in style, is another fragmentary statue of a horse without a rider, the
latter probably to be understood as standing in front of the horse, as in
some of the riders pictured on the Parthenon frieze. The two are good
examples of pre-Persian Attic sculpture.<a id="FNanchor_1988"></a><a href="#Footnote_1988" class="fnanchor">1988</a> A later example is the small
bronze statuette of an ephebe represented as a horseman (the horse is
lacking) discovered recently at the French excavations at Volubilis in
Morocco. This almost perfectly preserved work has been referred to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
the first half of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_1989"></a><a href="#Footnote_1989" class="fnanchor">1989</a> The position of the hands
holding the reins reminds us strongly of the Delphi <i>Charioteer</i> (Fig. <a href="#f66">66</a>).
The diadem in the hair shows that a victor is represented. A small
bronze statuette in the Loeb collection in Munich represents a boy
riding a prancing horse, which is standing on its hind legs. This vigorous,
but poorly finished, work is decorative in character and probably
once belonged to the crown of a candelabrum. It appears to be either
an Etruscan or early Roman work based on a Hellenistic original.<a id="FNanchor_1990"></a><a href="#Footnote_1990" class="fnanchor">1990</a></p>

<h3>THE APOBATES HORSE-RACE.</h3>

<p>In a previous section we discussed the <i>apobates</i> chariot-race run at
the Panathenaic games in Athens, in which the <i>apobates</i> leaped down
and ran to the goal abreast of the chariot. We shall now briefly speak
of a similar race at Olympia (the κάλπη) in which the rider leaped from
his mare in the last lap and ran with her to the goal.<a id="FNanchor_1991"></a><a href="#Footnote_1991" class="fnanchor">1991</a> There is no
certain illustration in sculpture or on vase-paintings of this race, but
Gardiner believes that something like it appears on coins of Tarentum,
on which a nude youth, armed with a small round shield, is represented
in the act of jumping from his horse.<a id="FNanchor_1992"></a><a href="#Footnote_1992" class="fnanchor">1992</a> The military character of this
race, like that of the <i>apobates</i> chariot-race discussed, is shown by the
shield held in the left hand of the dismounting horseman. Helbig has
shown that the Greek knight of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> was merely a
mounted infantryman, the successor of the Homeric warrior who used
his chariot merely for pursuit or flight, while actually fighting from the
ground.<a id="FNanchor_1993"></a><a href="#Footnote_1993" class="fnanchor">1993</a> Just so the knight rode to battle on his horse, but dismounted
when near the enemy, leaving the horse in charge of his squire, as the
Homeric chieftain left his chariot in charge of his charioteer. This old
custom of the heroic age survived not only in the Panathenaic chariot-race,
but also, for a few years in the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, in the Olympic
mare-race known as the κάλπη. It seems to have been instituted there
for military reasons in order to revive the old form of fighting that had
gone out of use just at the close of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, but it endured
for only a half century, from Ols. 71 to 84 (&#8239;=&#8239;496 to 444 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>). The
corresponding chariot-race at Athens and elsewhere continued at least
to the end of the fourth century <span class="smcap">B.&nbsp;C.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span></span></p>

<h3>DEDICATIONS OF MUSICAL VICTORS AT OLYMPIA AND
ELSEWHERE.</h3>

<p>In closing this chapter we shall say a few words about monuments
erected to trumpeters, heralds, and musical victors at Olympia, though
such contests had nothing to do with athletics.</p>

<p>Contests for trumpeters and heralds were held in many parts of
Greece.<a id="FNanchor_1994"></a><a href="#Footnote_1994" class="fnanchor">1994</a> They were introduced at Olympia in Ol. 96 (&#8239;=&#8239;396 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>),
when Timaios of Elis won as trumpeter and Krates of Elis as herald.<a id="FNanchor_1995"></a><a href="#Footnote_1995" class="fnanchor">1995</a>
Pausanias mentions an altar, near the entrance to the stadion, upon
which trumpeters and heralds stood when competing.<a id="FNanchor_1996"></a><a href="#Footnote_1996" class="fnanchor">1996</a> Such contests
seem to have been mere displays of lung power. Herodoros, for example,
who won as trumpeter at Olympia ten times in the last quarter
of the fourth and beginning of the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_1997"></a><a href="#Footnote_1997" class="fnanchor">1997</a>, could blow two
trumpets at once so loud that no one could stand near him.<a id="FNanchor_1998"></a><a href="#Footnote_1998" class="fnanchor">1998</a> To
perform such a feat he was said to be a very large man.<a id="FNanchor_1999"></a><a href="#Footnote_1999" class="fnanchor">1999</a> Diogenes,
son of Dionysios of Ephesos, won five victories in trumpeting at Olympia.
He was twice <i>periodonikes</i> and also won many other victories
at the Isthmus, Nemea, and elsewhere—eighty in all.<a id="FNanchor_2000"></a><a href="#Footnote_2000" class="fnanchor">2000</a> We have an
excellent bronze statuette of a trumpeter, which was found in the
Hieron of Athena Chalkioikos at Sparta, dating from the middle of
the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, about a century and a half before the event was
introduced at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_2001"></a><a href="#Footnote_2001" class="fnanchor">2001</a> This “little masterpiece of Spartan art,”
whose style resembles that of the Olympia pediment sculptures, represents
a nude man standing, the left arm hanging by his side, while the
right is bent upwards to the mouth, where it held a tubular object
pointing upwards. Since the lips are tightly compressed, Dickins
has interpreted the object as a trumpet. A much damaged bronze
statuette in the British Museum represents a man playing on a long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>
trumpet-shaped instrument.<a id="FNanchor_2002"></a><a href="#Footnote_2002" class="fnanchor">2002</a> Trumpeters also appear now and then
on r.-f. Attic vases of the middle of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span></p>

<p>Music victors played a greater role at Delphi than elsewhere, since
music from the first was the chief interest there. Monuments to such
victors, though few in number, by little-known artists were set up there,
but they seem to have enjoyed the same meagre honor at Delphi as the
statues of athletic victors.<a id="FNanchor_2003"></a><a href="#Footnote_2003" class="fnanchor">2003</a> We have record of a statue of the Epizephyrian
Locrian <i>kitharoidos</i> Eunomos, set up in his native town in
honor of his Pythian victory over Ariston of Rhegion. Timaios says that
this monument showed a cicada seated on the singer’s lyre.<a id="FNanchor_2004"></a><a href="#Footnote_2004" class="fnanchor">2004</a> Whether
such monuments at Delphi or elsewhere were regarded as victor or
votive in character, we can not say.<a id="FNanchor_2005"></a><a href="#Footnote_2005" class="fnanchor">2005</a> Pausanias mentions several
statues of poets and musicians, mostly mythical, on Mount Helikon,
which were set up partly in consequence of victories won there or elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_2006"></a><a href="#Footnote_2006" class="fnanchor">2006</a>
Of these the statue of the Thracian or Odrysian Thamyris
was represented as a blind man holding a broken lyre;<a id="FNanchor_2007"></a><a href="#Footnote_2007" class="fnanchor">2007</a> that of Arion
of Methymna as riding a dolphin;<a id="FNanchor_2008"></a><a href="#Footnote_2008" class="fnanchor">2008</a> that of Hesiod, seated, as holding a
lute on his knees; and that of the Thracian Orpheus with Telete at his
side and round about beasts in stone and bronze listening to his song.
Of the statue of the Argive Sakadas, Pausanias says that the sculptor,
not understanding Pindar’s poem on the victor, made the flutist
no bigger than the flute.<a id="FNanchor_2009"></a><a href="#Footnote_2009" class="fnanchor">2009</a> The epigram on the statue of the Sikyonian
flutist Bacchiadas, mentioned by Athenæus as standing on Mount
Helikon,<a id="FNanchor_2010"></a><a href="#Footnote_2010" class="fnanchor">2010</a> was votive in character. The inscribed base of the statue of
the <i>kitharoidos</i> Alkibios has been found on the Athenian Akropolis.<a id="FNanchor_2011"></a><a href="#Footnote_2011" class="fnanchor">2011</a>
Musical contests are pictured on many imitation Panathenaic vases,
and many Greek reliefs seem to have been set up in honor of such victors.
Among the latter we might instance the one in the Louvre representing
Apollo, Artemis, and Leto,<a id="FNanchor_2012"></a><a href="#Footnote_2012" class="fnanchor">2012</a> and another found in Sparta in
1885, which represents Artemis pouring a libation before Apollo.<a id="FNanchor_2013"></a><a href="#Footnote_2013" class="fnanchor">2013</a></p>

<p>At Olympia flute-playing accompanied certain of the events of the
pentathlon. Pausanias says that the reason why the flute played a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
Pythian air while the athletes jumped was that this air was sacred to
Apollo, who had beaten Hermes in running and Ares in boxing at
Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_2014"></a><a href="#Footnote_2014" class="fnanchor">2014</a> Thus on the chest of Kypselos a flutist was represented
as standing between Admetos and Mopsos at their boxing match.<a id="FNanchor_2015"></a><a href="#Footnote_2015" class="fnanchor">2015</a>
But the explanation given by Philostratos seems more sensible,
that leaping was a difficult contest, and that the flute stimulated the
jumpers.<a id="FNanchor_2016"></a><a href="#Footnote_2016" class="fnanchor">2016</a> At Argos, at the games in honor of Zeus Σθένιος, wrestlers
contended to the tune of the flute.<a id="FNanchor_2017"></a><a href="#Footnote_2017" class="fnanchor">2017</a> Many vase-paintings illustrate
flute-playing at the pentathlon.<a id="FNanchor_2018"></a><a href="#Footnote_2018" class="fnanchor">2018</a> At Olympia only a few monuments
were set up in honor of musical victors, and these seem to have been
statues erected <i>honoris causa</i>, instead of primarily for victories. An
example is that of the Sikyonian flutist Pythokritos, who won a victory
as αὐλητής in the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_2019"></a><a href="#Footnote_2019" class="fnanchor">2019</a> Pausanias says that his
monument was that of a small man with a flute wrought in relief on
an inscribed slab. The explanation of such a description probably is
that the size of the flute made the victor appear small, just as in the
case of the monument of Sakadas just mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_2020"></a><a href="#Footnote_2020" class="fnanchor">2020</a> We know that
artists, poets, prose writers, musicians, and actors all had an audience
at Olympia, and that statues were often erected there in honor
of such men, though these are not to be treated as victor monuments
and do not properly fall within the scope of the present work.<a id="FNanchor_2021"></a><a href="#Footnote_2021" class="fnanchor">2021</a></p>

<h3>THE GROUP OF DAOCHOS AT DELPHI, AND LYSIPPOS.</h3>

<p>If in these later years our knowledge of Skopas has been greatly
augmented by the discovery of the Tegea heads (Fig. <a href="#f73">73</a>), that of
Lysippos has been almost revolutionized. With the discovery in 1894
at Delphi of the group of statues dedicated by the Thessalian Daochos<a id="FNanchor_2023"></a><a href="#Footnote_2023" class="fnanchor">2023</a>
in honor of various members of his house, whose dates covered nearly
two centuries,<a id="FNanchor_2024"></a><a href="#Footnote_2024" class="fnanchor">2024</a> an entirely new impetus was given to the study of the
last of the great Greek sculptors. Homolle immediately recognized the
fourth-century origin of the group, and at first pronounced the statue
of Agias Lysippan;<a id="FNanchor_2025"></a><a href="#Footnote_2025" class="fnanchor">2025</a> later he saw in the types, poses, and proportions
of the group the mixed influences of Praxiteles, Skopas, and Lysippos,
but referred the <i>Agias</i> to the school of Skopas,<a id="FNanchor_2026"></a><a href="#Footnote_2026" class="fnanchor">2026</a> while still later he again
pronounced it Lysippan.<a id="FNanchor_2027"></a><a href="#Footnote_2027" class="fnanchor">2027</a> But its true character was not destined
to be long in doubt. When Erich Preuner<a id="FNanchor_2028"></a><a href="#Footnote_2028" class="fnanchor">2028</a> found almost the same
metrical inscription, which was on the base of the best preserved statue
of the group, that of Agias (Pl. <a href="#p28">28</a> and Fig. <a href="#f68">68</a>),<a id="FNanchor_2029"></a><a href="#Footnote_2029" class="fnanchor">2029</a> in the traveling journal
of Stackelberg,<a id="FNanchor_2030"></a><a href="#Footnote_2030" class="fnanchor">2030</a> copied from a base in Pharsalos, the Thessalian home of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>Daochos, with the additional information that Lysippos of Sikyon
made the statue, our views of the work of that artist had to undergo a
thorough revision. For this discovery brought the <i>Agias</i>—if not the
others of the group—into direct relation to Lysippos by documentary
evidence, while the easily recognized Lysippan characteristics of the
statue—the slender body and limbs, the small head, the proportions
and pose—confirmed this connection on stylistic grounds. It became
clear that Daochos had set up a series of statues in honor of his ancestors
both at Pharsalos and Delphi. Whether the Thessalian group
was of bronze, as is generally held, owing to the widespread belief
that Lysippos worked only in metal, and the Delphian group was composed
of contemporary marble copies of those originals, will be discussed
further on. If the marble group was a copy, we may infer that
it reproduced the original statues, not mechanically and laboriously as
was often the case in Roman days, but accurately; for having employed
a noted artist in the one case, the dedicator would have desired an
accurate reproduction of the work in the other.</p>

<h3>THE APOXYOMENOS OF THE VATICAN, AND LYSIPPOS.</h3>

<p>But another statue, the <i>Apoxyomenos</i>, of the Vatican (Pl. <a href="#p29">29</a>),<a id="FNanchor_2031"></a><a href="#Footnote_2031" class="fnanchor">2031</a> ever
since its discovery by Canina in 1849, had held the honored place
of being regarded as the centre of the stylistic treatment of Lysippos.
Seldom has the discovery of a Roman copy of a Greek original proved
so important for the study of ancient sculpture as this athlete statue,
which was found in an appropriate place, in the ruins of a building,
which almost certainly was a Roman bath. Despite unimportant
restorations, the statue is well preserved. The fingers of the right hand
holding the die were wrongly restored by the sculptor Tenerani at the
suggestion of Canina who wrongly interpreted the passage in Pliny
(XXXIV, 55), which refers to two works by Polykleitos, <i>destringentem
se et nudum talo incessentem</i>, as meaning one and the same monument.<a id="FNanchor_2032"></a><a href="#Footnote_2032" class="fnanchor">2032</a>
This slightly over life-size statue represents a nude athlete, who is standing
with legs far apart, employed in scraping the sand and oil from his
extended right arm with a strigil held in the left hand. This, as we saw
in Chapter III, was a common palæstra motive.<a id="FNanchor_2033"></a><a href="#Footnote_2033" class="fnanchor">2033</a> Despite certain portrait-like
features, this statue may not represent an individual victor,
but, like Myron’s great work, an athletic model. The words of Pliny,<a id="FNanchor_2034"></a><a href="#Footnote_2034" class="fnanchor">2034</a>
which mention one of the best-known works of Lysippos in antiquity—it
heads the list in his account of the sculptor—as an athlete <i>destringentem
se</i>, and his statement in another passage<a id="FNanchor_2035"></a><a href="#Footnote_2035" class="fnanchor">2035</a> that Lysippos introduced
a new canon into art <i>capita minora faciendo quam antiqui,
corpora graciliora siccioraque, per quae proceritas signorum major videretur</i>,
<i>i. e.</i>, a canon of bodily proportions essentially different from
that of Polykleitos, seemed to have their best illustration in the slender
and graceful body and limbs, and noticeably small head of this statue.
It was, therefore, though admittedly a Roman work, long regarded
as a direct copy of the Lysippan original, and as faithfully representing
his style in every detail.<a id="FNanchor_2036"></a><a href="#Footnote_2036" class="fnanchor">2036</a> Such a view, of course, was founded entirely
on circumstantial evidence, and could not survive any positive evidence
to the contrary which might come to light in the future. G. F. Hill, in
speaking of the insufficient evidence on which the <i>Apoxyomenos</i> had
been accepted as the key to Lysippan style, rightly remarks: “It is more
scientific, until we acquire documentary evidence of excellent character,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>to classify our extant examples of ancient art as representing tendencies
rather than men.”<a id="FNanchor_2037"></a><a href="#Footnote_2037" class="fnanchor">2037</a> The Lysippan character of the Vatican statue had not
been seriously attacked until the discovery of the <i>Agias</i>. Its original was
certainly a work worthy of Lysippos. Its rhythm, proportions, and fine
modeling have received praise of connoisseurs ever since its discovery.
Its difficult pose had been remarkably well executed. While appearing
at rest, the statue suggests vigorous action both by its supple limbs and
the suppressed excitement indicated by the partly opened lips, an excitement
befitting a victorious athlete. Perhaps it was the difficulty
of such a pose that best explains why the <i>Apoxyomenos</i> has left no other
copy.<a id="FNanchor_2038"></a><a href="#Footnote_2038" class="fnanchor">2038</a> The very excellence of the Vatican statue prejudiced us in
favor of regarding it as an illustration of Lysippos’ ideal of bodily proportions.
But we really knew very little of the original <i>Apoxyomenos</i>,
only what we gathered from Pliny, that Lysippos made such a statue
and that it was carried to Rome by M. Agrippa and was set up in front
of his Thermæ, whence it was removed by the enamored Tiberius to
his bed-chamber, only to be restored when the populace remonstrated.
As for the proportions of the supposed copy in question, they only
prove that this statue goes back to an original which was not earlier
than Lysippos, but not that it was by the master himself.<a id="FNanchor_2039"></a><a href="#Footnote_2039" class="fnanchor">2039</a> The discovery
of the <i>Agias</i> showed us at last on what slender foundations our
theory had been built. Despite certain well-marked similarities in the
pose, proportions, and relatively small head—characteristics which were
not even exclusively Lysippan, since they are just as prominent in certain
other works, <i>e. g.</i>, in the warriors of the Mausoleion frieze—between
the <i>Agias</i> and the <i>Apoxyomenos</i>, nevertheless just as striking differences
appear, which make it difficult to keep both statues as examples of the
artistic tendency of one and the same artist, even if we should assign
them to different periods of his career.</p>

<h3>THE AGIAS AND THE APOXYOMENOS COMPARED, AND THE
STYLE OF LYSIPPOS.</h3>

<p>These differences are most apparent in the surface modeling and
facial expression of the two works. In the <i>Agias</i> the muscles are not
over-emphasized in detail, but show the simple observation of nature
characteristic of artists who worked before the scientific study of
anatomy at the Museum of Alexandria had reacted upon sculpture. In
the <i>Apoxyomenos</i>, on the other hand, we see an intentional display of
the new learning in the labored and detailed treatment of the muscles,
which disclose a knowledge of anatomy unknown before the Hellenistic
age. This academic treatment, culminating later in such realistic works
as the <i>Laocoön</i> and the <i>Farnese Herakles</i>, can hardly have antedated the
beginning of the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, when anatomy was studied by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
physicians Herophilos and Erasistratos, a date after the close of the
activity of Lysippos. We see no trace of this influence in the <i>Agias</i>.
Moreover, the face of the latter discloses the intense expression, which is
elsewhere seen only in works supposed to be by, or influenced by, Skopas,
which recalls what Plutarch<a id="FNanchor_2040"></a><a href="#Footnote_2040" class="fnanchor">2040</a> said of Lysippos’ portraits of Alexander,
that they reproduced his masculine and leonine air (αὐτοῦ τὸ ἀρρενωπὸν
καὶ λεοντῶδες); for a comparison of this face with that of the <i>Apoxyomenos</i>,
which exhibits the lifelessness and lack of expression so characteristic
of many early Hellenistic works, makes it still more evident
that we must be on our guard against assuming that both works are
representative of the same sculptor. The essential differences in
physical type and artistic execution between the two statues have
been well summarized by K. T. Frost in a letter published by Prof.
Percy Gardner in the latter’s treatment of the same subject.<a id="FNanchor_2041"></a><a href="#Footnote_2041" class="fnanchor">2041</a> After a
careful analysis of these differences, Frost closes by saying: “It is difficult
to believe that the two statues represent works by the same artist;
it is not only the type of man, but the way in which that type is expressed
which forms the contrast.” He compares the <i>Apoxyomenos</i> with
the <i>Borghese Warrior</i> (Fig. <a href="#f43">43</a>) as true products of the Hellenistic age.</p>

<p>When we consider these differences between the two statues, we see
that our judgment of Lysippan art must depend on how we interpret
them. We may either flatly reject the <i>Apoxyomenos</i> and put the
<i>Agias</i> in its place as representing the norm of Lysippan art, or keep the
<i>Apoxyomenos</i> and reject the <i>Agias</i> as evidence; or lastly we may keep
both as characteristic works of two different periods in the artistic
career of Lysippos, explaining the differences as the result of influence
or of the lapse of years. A recent writer, to be sure, has cut the Gordian
knot by rejecting both statues, and placing the <i>Apoxyomenos</i> of
the Uffizi—which we have treated at length in a preceding chapter
(Pl. <a href="#p12">12</a>)—as the key to our knowledge of the art of Lysippos.<a id="FNanchor_2042"></a><a href="#Footnote_2042" class="fnanchor">2042</a> But
such a solution of the problem raises even more difficulties. Long
before the <i>Agias</i> came to light some critics, indeed, had doubted whether
the <i>Apoxyomenos</i> really represented the work of Lysippos, as its
Hellenistic character seemed evident. Thus, in 1877, Ulrich Koehler,<a id="FNanchor_2043"></a><a href="#Footnote_2043" class="fnanchor">2043</a>
following a still earlier judgment,<a id="FNanchor_2044"></a><a href="#Footnote_2044" class="fnanchor">2044</a> had come to the conclusion that the
Vatican statue was only a free reproduction of Lysippos’ masterpiece
and attributed its Hellenistic characteristics to the Roman copyist;
but even yet the school which long recognized the <i>Apoxyomenos</i> as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>
norm of Lysippos has its supporters,<a id="FNanchor_2045"></a><a href="#Footnote_2045" class="fnanchor">2045</a> though many archæologists
have now supplanted the <i>Apoxyomenos</i> by the <i>Agias</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2046"></a><a href="#Footnote_2046" class="fnanchor">2046</a> Others, not
willing to renounce the <i>Apoxyomenos</i> as evidence, accept both it and
the <i>Agias</i> as characteristic works of the master, appealing to the length
of his career to explain the differences, and suggesting that in his youth
Lysippos was under the influence of Skopas, but later in life attained
independence, and followed a more anatomical rendering for his athlete
statues.<a id="FNanchor_2047"></a><a href="#Footnote_2047" class="fnanchor">2047</a> However, despite the fact that other artists must have influenced
Lysippos,<a id="FNanchor_2048"></a><a href="#Footnote_2048" class="fnanchor">2048</a> the <i>Agias</i> can not be shown to be a youthful work
of his, nor can the special influence of Skopas be shown to have been
that of master on pupil, but rather of one great master on another and
equally great contemporary. The difficulty about penetrating the obscurity
surrounding Lysippos comes largely from the fact that he borrowed
traits from several of his predecessors and contemporaries. The
influence of Polykleitos, Skopas, and Praxiteles, and especially of the
last two, as Homolle emphasized in his study of the Daochos group,<a id="FNanchor_2049"></a><a href="#Footnote_2049" class="fnanchor">2049</a>
can be certainly traced in the <i>Agias</i>. Fräulein Bieber, in a recent
article,<a id="FNanchor_2050"></a><a href="#Footnote_2050" class="fnanchor">2050</a> while denying that Lysippos had anything to do with the
Delphian group, tries to prove that one figure in it shows the influence
of Praxiteles, another that of Polykleitos, and a third that of Skopas.
She believes that the sculptor of the <i>Agias</i> had seen the original bronze
statue, the work of Lysippos, which stood in Pharsalos. However, we
may leave any such conclusion to one side, and judge between the
<i>Agias</i> and the <i>Apoxyomenos</i> solely on the merits of the two statues.</p>

<p>The differences between them appear to us too great to be reconciled
on any such principles as those just rehearsed, for their style and tech<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span>nique
seem to represent two distinct periods of art. If one is to be
rejected, the connection of the <i>Agias</i> with Lysippos certainly rests on
better evidence than does the <i>Apoxyomenos</i>. By separating them completely,
it is possible both to assign to Lysippos the early date which
other evidence points to, and to remove the <i>Apoxyomenos</i> entirely from
the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, thus explaining its later modeling, comparatively
expressionless features, body-build (which shows the use of three
planes, instead of two), and other Hellenistic details. We should, then,
see in its original a work not by Lysippos at all, but by some pupil or
later member of his school, a work retaining merely traces of the style
of the master. In thus eliminating the <i>Apoxyomenos</i> we are justified
in following Homolle’s lead in assigning the statue of Agias to Lysippos,
in spite of arguments which have been adduced against attributing
it to Lysippos and in spite of recent criticism of the inscriptions of
the Delphian bases, by which Wolters tries to prove that the inscription
on the base of the statue of Agias, and consequently the <i>Agias</i>
itself, antedate the inscription and dedication at Pharsalos.<a id="FNanchor_2051"></a><a href="#Footnote_2051" class="fnanchor">2051</a> We may,
therefore, until further discoveries prove the contrary, consider it as
the centre of our treatment of that sculptor. Whether the <i>Apoxyomenos</i>
is to be explained as emanating from the immediate environment
of Lysippos, or is to be regarded as a work illustrating the last phase of
his development, or the innovation of another master—in any case it
seems to us clearly to belong to an age essentially different from that
which conceived the <i>Agias</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2052"></a><a href="#Footnote_2052" class="fnanchor">2052</a></p>

<p>As the <i>Agias</i> is a statue of a victor in the pankration, we can learn
from it how Lysippos represented such an athlete. In giving up the
<i>Apoxyomenos</i>, we must also give up statues of athletes which have
hitherto been assigned to Lysippos on the basis of their resemblance to
it, and the future ascription of statues of this class must be based on
stylistic resemblances to the statue of Agias. Thus, for example, we
should give up the statue of a youth in Berlin, and the two statues of
athletes represented in lunging attitudes in Dresden, which Furtwaengler,
on the basis of the <i>Apoxyomenos</i>, believed were copies of originals
by Lysippos,<a id="FNanchor_2053"></a><a href="#Footnote_2053" class="fnanchor">2053</a> and the Roman male head in Turin, published by A. J. B.
Wace,<a id="FNanchor_2054"></a><a href="#Footnote_2054" class="fnanchor">2054</a> whose original is somewhat later than that of the <i>Apoxyomenos</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>
On the basis of the <i>Agias</i>, on the other hand, we may regard as Lysippan
the statue of an athlete in Copenhagen,<a id="FNanchor_2055"></a><a href="#Footnote_2055" class="fnanchor">2055</a> and perhaps the Parian marble
statue of an athlete from the Palazzo Farnese now in the British
Museum,<a id="FNanchor_2056"></a><a href="#Footnote_2056" class="fnanchor">2056</a> with copies in Paris and Rome.<a id="FNanchor_2057"></a><a href="#Footnote_2057" class="fnanchor">2057</a> This latter statue Furtwaengler
ascribed to the school of Kalamis of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>,
on account of the similarity of its style to that of the <i>Apollo-on-the-Omphalos</i>
(Fig. 7B) and of its motive to that of the <i>Lansdowne Herakles</i>
(Fig. <a href="#f71">71</a> and Pl. <a href="#p30">30</a>); however, A. H. Smith finds it very similar to the
<i>Agias</i>, and so rightly refers it to the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span></p>

<h3>THE HEAD FROM OLYMPIA.</h3>

<p>Impressed by its remarkable likeness to the head of the <i>Agias</i>, I
hazarded the opinion some years ago,<a id="FNanchor_2058"></a><a href="#Footnote_2058" class="fnanchor">2058</a> that the much discussed Pentelic
marble head from Olympia (<a href="#fr">Frontispiece</a> and Figure <a href="#f69">69</a>)<a id="FNanchor_2059"></a><a href="#Footnote_2059" class="fnanchor">2059</a> was Lysippan,

and attempted to bring it into relation
with the statue of the Akarnanian pancratiast
(whose name I restored as Philandridas),
which Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_2060"></a><a href="#Footnote_2060" class="fnanchor">2060</a> says was the
work of Lysippos. Since then, after a
careful revision of the evidence, this earlier
opinion has become conviction, and I
now have no hesitancy in expressing the
belief that in this vigorous marble head
we have to do with an original work by
Lysippos himself. It will be our task briefly
to rehearse the reasons for making such
an ascription, despite the serious and
weighty objections which might be raised
against it.</p>

<p>At first this head was ascribed with surprising
unanimity to the school of Praxiteles,<a id="FNanchor_2061"></a><a href="#Footnote_2061" class="fnanchor">2061</a>
and subsequently, after the discovery
of the Tegea heads, with almost
equal unanimity to that of Skopas. Treu, who first published the
head,<a id="FNanchor_2062"></a><a href="#Footnote_2062" class="fnanchor">2062</a> pointed out its near relationship to the <i>Hermes</i> of Praxiteles,
which appeared to him to be obvious, notwithstanding the injured con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span>dition
of the chin, nose, mouth, and brows. He found the general proportions,
the shape of the cranium and forehead, and the form of the
cheeks and mouth the same in both, while the differences, such as the
deeper cut and wider opened eyes with their γοργόν expression, the
hair, and the fact that the head is harder, leaner, and bonier than that
of the <i>Hermes</i>, were all explained by the different character given to the
statue of a victor or Herakles. Many other archæologists, as Boetticher,<a id="FNanchor_2063"></a><a href="#Footnote_2063" class="fnanchor">2063</a>
Laloux and Monceaux,<a id="FNanchor_2064"></a><a href="#Footnote_2064" class="fnanchor">2064</a> and Furtwaengler,<a id="FNanchor_2065"></a><a href="#Footnote_2065" class="fnanchor">2065</a> have also seen sure signs of
the hand of Praxiteles or his school in the graceful attitude, delicate
chiseling, and finish of the work. Still others,<a id="FNanchor_2066"></a><a href="#Footnote_2066" class="fnanchor">2066</a> however, found every
characteristic of Skopas in this head. Even Treu in his later treatment
of the head found it more Skopaic than Praxitelian, and yet, by a careful
analysis,<a id="FNanchor_2067"></a><a href="#Footnote_2067" class="fnanchor">2067</a> he conclusively showed that the formation of the eyes, the
opening of the mouth, and the treatment of the hair were so different
in the heads from Tegea (and especially in that of the <i>Herakles</i>, Fig. <a href="#f73">73</a>)
as to preclude the possibility of assigning them and the head from
Olympia to the same sculptor, and so declared for some independent
sculptor among the contemporaries of Skopas. However, he did not
see Lysippos in this allied but independent artist, though he admitted
the resemblance of the head in question to that of the <i>Agias</i>, as also
Homolle,<a id="FNanchor_2068"></a><a href="#Footnote_2068" class="fnanchor">2068</a> Mahler,<a id="FNanchor_2069"></a><a href="#Footnote_2069" class="fnanchor">2069</a> and other critics have done.</p>

<h3>THE OLYMPIA HEAD AND THAT OF THE AGIAS.</h3>

<p>A detailed comparison of this head with that of the <i>Agias</i> will show
wherein the wonderful resemblance—so striking at first glance—consists
and will disclose its Lysippan character. Neither head is a portrait,
nor even individualized; the <i>Agias</i> could be no portrait, for Agias
was the great-grandfather of Daochos, who enlisted the services of his
contemporary Lysippos in erecting his statue, and he won his victory
in the pankration more than a century before this statue was set up.<a id="FNanchor_2070"></a><a href="#Footnote_2070" class="fnanchor">2070</a>
A glance at the head from Olympia also clearly discloses its ideal character;
for it is no portrait of Philandridas, but the victor κατ’ ἐξοχήν in
the pankration. The small head of the <i>Agias</i>—under life-size—first
arrests attention as the chief characteristic of the whole statue and
(taken with the other proportions of the body) as the chief mark of its
Lysippan origin. As Homolle says, it is not that small heads are not
found outside the school of Lysippos or before his day—for Myron can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>
furnish examples of them—but it is only with Lysippos and after him
that we see a conscious intention of having the proportions thus reduced.
Now the head from Olympia is also less than life-size,<a id="FNanchor_2071"></a><a href="#Footnote_2071" class="fnanchor">2071</a> but as
the head alone is preserved, we can only assume that the proportions
it bore to the body were similar to those we see in the statue of Agias.
The conformation of the crania of both is, as in Attic works, round, with
small, only slightly projecting occiputs, as opposed to the squareness of
Polykleitan heads, which are longer from front to back and flatter on
top—showing how Lysippos in this respect departed from the creator
of the <i>Doryphoros</i>. This cranial conformation is almost identical in the
two heads, as is clearly shown in Fig. <a href="#f70">70</a>, where one is drawn in profile
over the other.</p>

<div class="figcenter400"><a id="f70"></a>
<img src="images/i_p295.jpg" width="400" height="203" alt="Profile Drawings of the Heads of the Agias." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 70.</span>—Profile Drawings of the Heads of the <i>Agias</i>
and the <i>Philandridas</i>.</div>
</div>

<p>The head of the <i>Agias</i> is turned slightly upward and to the left.
Treu found traces of the use of a file on the back of the neck of the head
from Olympia, which show from their position, what also was clear
from the muscles of the throat, that this head also was inclined somewhat
to the left and upward, possibly more than that of the <i>Agias</i>.
The outlines of the face—lean and bony in both—are oval, in the head
from Olympia somewhat broader, rounder, and fleshier toward the chin.
In both the forehead is remarkably low, with a low depression or crease
in the middle, and with a prominently projecting superciliary arcade,
which breaks the continuous line from forehead to nose very perceptibly.
This line is concave above and below, but convex at the projection
itself, though this is less prominent in the <i>Agias</i>. The powerful
framing of the eyes, which are deep-set and thrown into heavy shadows
by the projecting bony structure of the brows and the overhanging
masses of flesh, the eyeballs slightly raised and peering eagerly into the
far distance, the slight upward inclination of the head, and the
prominent forehead drawn together, all combine to give both heads<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>
(though young and vigorous) a pensive, even a sad look of heroic dignity,
a look seemingly of one who takes no joy nor pleasure in victory,
though it is not mournful. This humid and pensive expression was
doubtless a characteristic of works of Lysippos—it was, as we know,
present in his portraits of Alexander—but he did not treat it with as
great intensity as did Skopas.</p>

<p>The eyeballs in both heads are strongly arched, though the inner
angles are not so deep as in Skopaic heads; the raised upper lids
form a symmetrically narrow and sharply defined border over the eyeball,
and in neither head is this lid covered by a fold of skin at the outer
corners, as in the Tegea heads; the mass of flesh at the outer corners is
heavier in the head from Olympia, and the expression of the eyes is more
free and defiant than in the more meditative <i>Agias</i>. In both, the cheek
bones are high and prominent. The elegant contour of the lips of the
<i>Agias</i> is wholly wanting in the head from Olympia, in which the lips are
broken off, like the nose and the chin, but it is clear that the lips were
slightly parted, just showing the teeth—not, however, as in the Tegea
examples, as if the breath were being drawn with great effort. The
look of pensiveness is also increased by the open lips. The contour of
the jawbone is not so visible as in the <i>Agias</i>, where it is clearly discernible
beneath the closely drawn skin, giving the face a look of greater
leanness, as of an athlete in perfect training.</p>

<p>In both heads the swollen and battered ears, though small, are prominent,
and in both the hair is closely cropped, as becomes the athlete.
The hair of the <i>Agias</i> does not show so much expression as is displayed
in that of some Lysippan heads, nor the fine detail we should expect
from Pliny’s statement that Lysippos made improvements in the
rendering of the hair<a id="FNanchor_2072"></a><a href="#Footnote_2072" class="fnanchor">2072</a>—for it is in great measure only sketched out.
In Lysippan portraits of Alexander the hair is generally expressively
treated, and this is often the case in early Hellenistic heads.<a id="FNanchor_2073"></a><a href="#Footnote_2073" class="fnanchor">2073</a> However,
we should not expect an elaborate treatment of the hair in the
statue of a pancratiast. The head from Olympia also shows great
simplicity in this regard. As in Skopaic heads, the hair is fashioned
into little ringlets ruffled straight up from the forehead in flat relief,
but here the curls are shorter and more tense. It covers the temples
and surrounds the ears as in the <i>Agias</i>, but it is not, as there, bounded
by a round, floating line across the forehead, nor divided into little
tufts modeled in relief radiating in concentric circles from the top of
the head. While lacking in detail, the hair of the <i>Agias</i> is treated
carefully, and with the greatest variety. Narrow bands, perhaps the
insignia of victory, despite their small size, encircle both heads; in
the <i>Agias</i> the band is dexterously used to heighten the effect of variety<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span>
in the hair by alternately flattening and swelling it here and there. In
neither head is there any sign of the use of the drill to work out the
tufts of the hair; only the chisel was used.<a id="FNanchor_2074"></a><a href="#Footnote_2074" class="fnanchor">2074</a></p>

<p>Finally, the whole expression of these two ideal heads is one of force
and energy, of heroic dignity tempered by pensiveness and pathos,
which is, in the head from Olympia at least, even a little dramatic.
Both heads, while ideal, show close observation of nature in modeling
and expression; and both show the predilection of Lysippos for types in
which force and energy predominate, and his indifference to the softer
and more delicate types of manly beauty so characteristic of his contemporary,
Praxiteles.</p>

<p>In the foregoing comparison, we have tacitly assumed that this marble
head is from an athlete statue, and, moreover, that it, as the <i>Agias</i>,
represents a victor in the pankration, though many have seen in it the
representation not of a victor, but of a youthful Herakles.<a id="FNanchor_2075"></a><a href="#Footnote_2075" class="fnanchor">2075</a> The swollen
ears and the band in the hair might pass equally well for either, just as
the fact that it was unearthed near the ruins of the Great Gymnasion (if
it were necessary to assume that the statue once stood there) might be
adduced as evidence for either interpretation; for statues of athletes
<span class="figright250"><a id="f71"></a>

Herakles." />

Herakles (Pl. <a href="#p30">30</a>). Lansdowne
House, London.</span></span>as well as those of Herakles and Hermes (as we have shown in Ch. II)<a id="FNanchor_2076"></a><a href="#Footnote_2076" class="fnanchor">2076</a>
adorned palæstræ and gymnasia. That the head is of marble and
slightly under life-size seems to lend some support also to the belief that
it is a fragment of a statue of Herakles, on the assumption that statues
of victors in the Altis were uniformly of bronze, an assumption, however,
not supported by the facts, as will be shown in Chapter VII. So
some have seen the heroic features of the youthful hero in the γοργόν
of the eyes, the energetic forehead, closely cropped hair, muscular neck,
and almost challenging inclination of the head seemingly corresponding
with an energetic raising of the left shoulder.<a id="FNanchor_2077"></a><a href="#Footnote_2077" class="fnanchor">2077</a> In Chapter III we saw
that swollen ears were of little use in determining whether a given head
belongs to the statue of a victor or to one of Herakles, since they formed
no personal characteristic, but only a professional one common to athletes
and to gods, if these latter were concerned with athletics.<a id="FNanchor_2078"></a><a href="#Footnote_2078" class="fnanchor">2078</a> Where
personal attributes are absent, it is often difficult, therefore, to determine
whether an ideal athlete or Herakles is intended, for it may be the
hero in the guise of the athlete, or an athlete in the guise of the hero.
The head under discussion, then, may furnish merely another illustration
of the process of assimilation of type which we have already discussed.
Thus it is not surprising that some have regarded this head as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>
that of a youthful Herakles. Yet such a view is wrong; for, apart from
all considerations which we shall adduce to identify it with the Akarnanian
pancratiast, and in the absence of distinguishing attributes, if we
compare it with another Lysippan
head from a statue generally recognized
as that of a Herakles—the
famous Pentelic marble one in Lansdowne
House, London (Pl. <a href="#p30">30</a> and
Fig. <a href="#f71">71</a>),<a id="FNanchor_2079"></a><a href="#Footnote_2079" class="fnanchor">2079</a> which Michaelis long ago
characterized as “unmistakably in
the spirit of Lysippos”—we can see
how fundamentally different is the
whole spiritual conception of the
two, and how differently an athlete
(even if highly idealized) and a
hero are treated by the same sculptor.
If we once recognize a victor
in the head from Olympia, then
the swollen ears, the fierce, barbarous
look of the eyes, and the half-painful
expression of the mouth,
all concur in convincing us that we
here have to do with a victor in
boxing or the pankration, the two
most brutal and dangerous contests.</p>

<h3>IDENTIFICATION OF THE OLYMPIA HEAD.</h3>

<div class="caption">Statue of Herakles. Lansdowne House, London.</div>
</div>

<p>Having established, then, the Lysippan character of the head and
the probability that it comes from the statue of a boxer or pancratiast,
we shall next discuss the evidence for identifying it with one of the
monuments mentioned by Pausanias in his <i>periegesis</i> of the Altis. He
names only five statues of victors by Lysippos: those of Troilos,<a id="FNanchor_2080"></a><a href="#Footnote_2080" class="fnanchor">2080</a> victor
in the two- and four-horse chariot-races; of Philandridas<a id="FNanchor_2081"></a><a href="#Footnote_2081" class="fnanchor">2081</a> and of Polydamas,<a id="FNanchor_2082"></a><a href="#Footnote_2082" class="fnanchor">2082</a>
victors in the pankration; of Cheilon,<a id="FNanchor_2083"></a><a href="#Footnote_2083" class="fnanchor">2083</a> victor in wrestling, and of
Kallikrates,<a id="FNanchor_2084"></a><a href="#Footnote_2084" class="fnanchor">2084</a> victor in the hoplite-race. Of these, the only two which
can come into consideration are those of the two pancratiasts; and one
of these, that of Polydamas, can at once be eliminated; for this small
head can have had nothing to do with the pretentious monument mentioned
by Pausanias in these words: ὁ δὲ ἐπὶ τῷ βάθρῳ τῷ ὑψηλῷ
Λυσίππου μέν ἐστιν ἔργον, μέγιστος δὲ ἁπάντων ἐγένετο ἀνθρώπων, κ. τ. λ.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">299</a></span>
Fragments of the base of this monument have been recovered, and it
stood in a part of the Altis<a id="FNanchor_2085"></a><a href="#Footnote_2085" class="fnanchor">2085</a> too far removed from the spot where the
statue of Philandridas stood, or from that where the marble head was
found. Our choice is limited to the statue of the Akarnanian, the tenth
in the series of 168 victors<a id="FNanchor_2086"></a><a href="#Footnote_2086" class="fnanchor">2086</a> named by Pausanias in his first <i>ephodos</i>.</p>

<p>We can determine very closely the position of these first few statues
in the Altis. Pausanias begins his enumeration ἐν δεξιᾷ τοῦ ναοῦ τῆς
Ἥρας, in the northwest of the sacred enclosure.<a id="FNanchor_2087"></a><a href="#Footnote_2087" class="fnanchor">2087</a> He is often loose
in his employment of words to denote locations, and especially so in
that of the terms ἐν δεξιᾷ and ἐν ἀριστερᾷ, which must sometimes be
interpreted from the viewpoint of the spectator, and sometimes from
that of a given monument. We shall show in Chapter VIII that these
words in this connection must be taken as referring to the temple <i>pro
persona</i>, and consequently to the southern side of the Heraion. The
marble head was found in this neighborhood, in the wall of some late
Byzantine huts behind the southern end of the stadion-hall of the Great
Gymnasion, 23.50 meters north of its southeastern corner and 5 meters
east of its back wall,<a id="FNanchor_2088"></a><a href="#Footnote_2088" class="fnanchor">2088</a> and consequently very near the Heraion. Inasmuch
as the inscribed tablet from the base of the statue of Troilos,<a id="FNanchor_2089"></a><a href="#Footnote_2089" class="fnanchor">2089</a>
the sixth statue mentioned by Pausanias, and the inscribed base of the
monument of Kyniska,<a id="FNanchor_2090"></a><a href="#Footnote_2090" class="fnanchor">2090</a> the seventh, were both found in the ruins of the
Prytaneion nearby, and the basis of the statue of Sophios,<a id="FNanchor_2091"></a><a href="#Footnote_2091" class="fnanchor">2091</a> the twenty-second
in the series, was discovered also in this part of the Altis, in the
bed of the Kladeos,<a id="FNanchor_2092"></a><a href="#Footnote_2092" class="fnanchor">2092</a> we can conclude that all four monuments originally
stood near together, and in the order named by Pausanias, along
the southern side of the Heraion. The remarkably good preservation
of the surface of the marble head points to the fact that it was set up in
a sheltered place.<a id="FNanchor_2093"></a><a href="#Footnote_2093" class="fnanchor">2093</a> Furthermore, the unfinished condition of the back
hair, which is only roughly blocked out, so that not even the contour
of the locks is indicated, shows that the statue was intended to be set
up against a solid background, <i>i. e.</i>, in front of a wall, niche, or column.<a id="FNanchor_2094"></a><a href="#Footnote_2094" class="fnanchor">2094</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span>
From this fact we may conclude that the statue of Philandridas, and
perhaps those of some of the other victors first mentioned by Pausanias,
stood on the southern stylobate of the Heraion, over against the columns
of the peristyle.</p>

<h3>THE DATES OF PHILANDRIDAS AND LYSIPPOS.</h3>

<p>The date of the victory of Philandridas is not recorded, but it
probably must lie within the years of the activity of Lysippos, who
made the statue.<a id="FNanchor_2095"></a><a href="#Footnote_2095" class="fnanchor">2095</a> On the principle which has been sufficiently demonstrated
in my monograph <i>de olympionicarum Statuis</i>, that statues
of nearly contemporaneous victors were grouped together in the
Altis, as well as those of the same family and state, or those who had
been victorious in the same contest, I have already in that work<a id="FNanchor_2096"></a><a href="#Footnote_2096" class="fnanchor">2096</a> proposed
Ol. 102 or Ol. 103 (&#8239;=&#8239;372 or 368 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>) as the probable date of his
victory, as his statue stands among those of victors, none of whom could
have won later than Ol. 104 (&#8239;=&#8239;364 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>). The first six named by
Pausanias are Eleans and the dates of their victories fall between Ols.
94 and 104 (&#8239;=&#8239;404 and 364 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>); the sixth, Troilos, is known to have
won his two victories in Ols. 102 and 103.<a id="FNanchor_2097"></a><a href="#Footnote_2097" class="fnanchor">2097</a> None of the next seven
Spartans—among whose statues that of Philandridas was placed—can
be dated later than Ol. 97 (&#8239;=&#8239;392 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), while most of them belong to
the close of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> Sostratos of Sikyon won in the same
contest in which Philandridas did in Ol. 104 (&#8239;=&#8239;364 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>);<a id="FNanchor_2098"></a><a href="#Footnote_2098" class="fnanchor">2098</a> and doubtless
his two other known victories should be assigned to the two succeeding
Olympiads. To bring Philandridas down as far as Ol. 107
(&#8239;=&#8239;352 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>) is unwarranted, since no statue of so late a date stood in
this vicinity. On the other hand, to place his victory earlier than
Ol. 102, is also out of the question, owing to the inexpediency of dating
Lysippos so early. Doubtless, therefore, his statue by Lysippos was
placed in the Spartan group about the same time that the image of
Troilos, by the same sculptor, was placed among the Eleans. This is
an independent argument, then, for so early a date for Lysippos.<a id="FNanchor_2099"></a><a href="#Footnote_2099" class="fnanchor">2099</a></p>

<p>Percy Gardner, in the discussion of the date of this artist,<a id="FNanchor_2100"></a><a href="#Footnote_2100" class="fnanchor">2100</a> has shown
how slight is the evidence for any date later than 320 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> The date<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span>
of the second Olympic victory of Cheilon of Patrai, whose statue was
by Lysippos, can not be later than 320 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_2101"></a><a href="#Footnote_2101" class="fnanchor">2101</a> Pausanias quotes the
inscription on the base of the statue to the effect that Cheilon died in
battle and was buried for his valor’s sake by the Achæan people. He
infers the date of his death by reference to the date of Lysippos as
either 338 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> (Chæroneia) or 322 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> (Lamia). In another passage,
VII, 6.5, he says that the Olympic guide told him that Cheilon was
the only Achæan who fought at Lamia. Gardner justly remarks
that either of these dates, the two occasions in the lifetime of Lysippos
when the Achæans took part in an important war, fall within the
dates of the artist’s activity.<a id="FNanchor_2102"></a><a href="#Footnote_2102" class="fnanchor">2102</a> The dates of the two hoplite victories
of Kallikrates of Magnesia, on the Meander, whose statue was also
the work of Lysippos, must be left indeterminate.<a id="FNanchor_2103"></a><a href="#Footnote_2103" class="fnanchor">2103</a> Gardner also shows
that the wish not to separate Lysippos from the <i>Apoxyomenos</i> has been
the real reason which has influenced so many archæologists to extend
his activity to the end of the fourth century,<a id="FNanchor_2104"></a><a href="#Footnote_2104" class="fnanchor">2104</a> and to explain away
the evidence for an earlier date offered by the statue of Troilos, who
won his second victory in 368 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> If we once for all give up the
<i>Apoxyomenos</i>, the difficulty of an early dating disappears, as does also
the theory that Skopas could have strongly influenced the youthful
Lysippos as a master would influence a pupil, and it becomes clear
that this influence must have been mutual, that of one great contemporary
upon another. Although Lysippos worked longer, as is attested
by his work for Alexander and his generals, he could have been but
little if any younger than either Skopas or Praxiteles, from both of
whom he learned. We have already quoted Homolle<a id="FNanchor_2105"></a><a href="#Footnote_2105" class="fnanchor">2105</a> as saying that
an analysis of the style of the <i>Agias</i> discloses the mixed influences of
Praxiteles and Skopas, as well as the independent work of Lysippos,
in the pose, proportions, and whole type of the figure.</p>

<p>Lysippos was a great reformer in art, breaking away from Argive
and Polykleitan traditions, even though he called the <i>Doryphoros</i> as
well as Nature his master, and though the influence of Polykleitos is
visible in the body of the <i>Agias</i>, just as that of Skopas in the treatment
of its forehead, eyes, and mouth, and in the intensity of its expression.
Evidently he was strongly affected by the work of his great predeces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">302</a></span>sors
and contemporaries, but developed at the same time new and independent
tendencies. Thus the <i>Philandridas</i> must have been—just as
the lost statue of Troilos—an early work of the master, whereas the
<i>Agias</i> was the work of his mature genius. The difference between the
two can thus be explained by the lapse of time between them, and by
the influences that surrounded the youthful artist; but the similarities
between them are, at the same time, striking, and there is little resemblance
in either to the <i>Apoxyomenos</i>. This is another link in the
chain of evidence that the latter work could not have been produced
by the same artist; for artists do not radically change their style after
many years of work, and Lysippos must have been at least fifty
years old when he created the <i>Agias</i>.</p>

<p>The identification of this marble head with that of the victor statue
of the Akarnanian pancratiast by Lysippos raises two questions which
we shall briefly examine: whether the statues in the Altis were ever
made of marble, and whether Lysippos ever worked in that material.
The first of these questions will be left for the following chapter; the
second will be discussed in the present connection.</p>

<h3>LYSIPPOS AS A WORKER IN MARBLE, AND
STATUE “DOUBLES.”</h3>

<p>To regard a marble statue as an original work of Lysippos, who has
been looked upon almost universally as a sculptor in bronze exclusively,
seems at first sight to be baseless. Pliny certainly classed Lysippos
among the bronze-workers, for in the preface to his account of bronze-founders<a id="FNanchor_2106"></a><a href="#Footnote_2106" class="fnanchor">2106</a>
he tells us that this artist produced 1,500 statues, and doubtless
we are to infer that the historian regarded them all as being made
of metal. He further<a id="FNanchor_2107"></a><a href="#Footnote_2107" class="fnanchor">2107</a> speaks of Lysippos’ contributions to the (<i>ars</i>)
<i>statuaria</i>, and it seems clear that this term, as the modern title of Book
XXXIV, is to be taken in its narrow sense of sculpture in bronze as opposed
to <i>sculptura</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2108"></a><a href="#Footnote_2108" class="fnanchor">2108</a> that in marble. How firmly the belief is established
that Lysippos worked only in bronze can be seen from the following
words of Overbeck: “<i>Zu  beginnen ist mit wiederholter Hervorhebung
der durchaus unzweifelhaften und wichtigen Tatsache dass Lysippos
ausschliesslich Erzgiesser war.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_2109"></a><a href="#Footnote_2109" class="fnanchor">2109</a> That Lysippos was preëminently a
bronze-worker, and that his ancient reputation was due chiefly to
his bronze work, can not be doubted. But to say that he never
essayed to produce works in marble, as so many other Greek artists<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span>
did who were famed as bronze-workers,<a id="FNanchor_2110"></a><a href="#Footnote_2110" class="fnanchor">2110</a> is, as one writer has lately
expressed it, a <i>kindisches Vorurtheil</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2111"></a><a href="#Footnote_2111" class="fnanchor">2111</a> That marble work was done
in his studio, if not by his hand, is well attested by the reliefs from
the base of the victor statue of Polydamas mentioned above, which
have been generally referred to Lysippos’ pupils.<a id="FNanchor_2112"></a><a href="#Footnote_2112" class="fnanchor">2112</a> These are too
damaged to be used as exact evidence of his style, but the legs of Polydamas
himself, in the central relief, so far as their contour can be made
out, are thin and sinewy, as we should expect in Lysippan work, and this
relief doubtless would have been regarded as the work of the master
himself, if it had not been taken for granted that he worked only in
bronze. But for the same assumption some critics would have seen
an original from the hand of Lysippos in the statue of Agias at least,
if not in the others of the Delphian group.<a id="FNanchor_2113"></a><a href="#Footnote_2113" class="fnanchor">2113</a> It will be interesting to
rehearse some of the arguments by which the statue of Agias has been
adjudged a copy.<a id="FNanchor_2114"></a><a href="#Footnote_2114" class="fnanchor">2114</a></p>

<p>It has been generally assumed that the original group of statues at
Pharsalos was of bronze (though we have no proof that it may not have
been of marble), while the one at Delphi was copied almost, if not quite,
simultaneously in marble<a id="FNanchor_2115"></a><a href="#Footnote_2115" class="fnanchor">2115</a>—so faithfully, indeed, that even the proper
marble support to the figure of Agias was omitted. While Homolle
notes the absence of this support as evidence of the marble statue being
an exact copy of the original bronze, Gardner argues that this proves a free
imitation, where the support was not needed.<a id="FNanchor_2116"></a><a href="#Footnote_2116" class="fnanchor">2116</a> The inexact modeling
of the hair, since hair can not be rendered so perfectly in marble as in
bronze, has been adduced as a sign that the marble statue was a copy of
the bronze original. This in itself is a weak argument, since the slight
and sketchy treatment of the hair of the <i>Hermes</i> of Praxiteles—which is,
for the most part, merely blocked out<a id="FNanchor_2117"></a><a href="#Footnote_2117" class="fnanchor">2117</a>—might with just as good reason
be used as evidence that that statue is only a copy, especially as we know
that Praxiteles also worked in bronze.<a id="FNanchor_2118"></a><a href="#Footnote_2118" class="fnanchor">2118</a> The omission of the artist’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">304</a></span>
signature on the base of the <i>Agias</i> has also been taken to indicate that
some pupil of Lysippos (Lysistratos, for example) did the work of transference
in the master’s studio under his supervision and doubtless from
his model.</p>

<p>Despite all such arguments, which prove little, it must be admitted
that the careless finish of the Delphian statue is not what we should
expect in a masterpiece by so renowned a sculptor as Lysippos, as the
statue can not be said to be a first-rate work of art. But that it was made
under the direct supervision of Lysippos can hardly be questioned. It
seems reasonable to believe that Daochos, who employed the great
artist in the one case, would not have trusted a mere copyist in the other,
or one who was free to indulge his individual taste in details,<a id="FNanchor_2119"></a><a href="#Footnote_2119" class="fnanchor">2119</a> especially
as the statue was to be placed in so prominent a place as Delphi. He
probably gave the orders for the two statues at the same time, and
Lysippos must have had the oversight of the Delphian one. So it seems
best to regard the statue of Agias as a “double,” and not as a copy in
the later sense of the word. The custom of making such doubles goes
back at least to the middle of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> Thus the statue
of the <i>Delian Apollo</i> by Angelion and Tektaios, known as the “<i>Healer</i>”
(Οὔλιος),<a id="FNanchor_2120"></a><a href="#Footnote_2120" class="fnanchor">2120</a> had a “double” in both Delphi<a id="FNanchor_2121"></a><a href="#Footnote_2121" class="fnanchor">2121</a> and Athens.<a id="FNanchor_2122"></a><a href="#Footnote_2122" class="fnanchor">2122</a> Similarly the
<i>Philesian Apollo</i> of Branchidai near Miletos, by the elder Kanachos,<a id="FNanchor_2123"></a><a href="#Footnote_2123" class="fnanchor">2123</a>
had a double in Thebes known as the <i>Ismenian Apollo</i>, which Pausanias
says differed from the one in Miletos neither in form nor size, but only
in material, for it was of cedar-wood,<a id="FNanchor_2124"></a><a href="#Footnote_2124" class="fnanchor">2124</a> while the Milesian one was of
bronze. Furtwaengler<a id="FNanchor_2125"></a><a href="#Footnote_2125" class="fnanchor">2125</a> has demonstrated that contemporary doubles
of works by Polykleitos, Pheidias, and Praxiteles existed. The
case of the statues of the athlete Agias at Pharsalos and at Delphi
is paralleled by that of the Olympic victor Promachos, who had
statues, probably alike, both at Olympia and in his native city Pellene.<a id="FNanchor_2126"></a><a href="#Footnote_2126" class="fnanchor">2126</a>
A double of the base of the <i>Nike</i> of Paionios at Olympia was
discovered at Delphi,<a id="FNanchor_2127"></a><a href="#Footnote_2127" class="fnanchor">2127</a> and a fine head in the collection of Miss
Hertz in Rome is from the same original.<a id="FNanchor_2128"></a><a href="#Footnote_2128" class="fnanchor">2128</a> A Polykleitan head<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a></span>
in the British Museum, similar to that of the <i>Westmacott Athlete</i>
(Pl. <a href="#p19">19</a>), seems to be a contemporary replica of an original of the fifth
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_2129"></a><a href="#Footnote_2129" class="fnanchor">2129</a> Such examples (and many more could be cited) show
the difference between contemporary “doubles” and the later copies
of Greek masterpieces. The former are Greek originals in a very
true sense, made, as we assume the <i>Agias</i> was, under the direct supervision
of noted sculptors. In this sense only the Delphian statue
should be called a copy.</p>

<h3>HEAD OF A STATUE OF A BOY FROM SPARTA, AND THE
ART OF SKOPAS.</h3>

<p>We shall next discuss the beautiful Pentelic marble head of a boy,
with a lion’s scalp drawn over the top so that the muzzle comes down
over the forehead, which is said to have been discovered near the
<span class="figright250"><a id="f72"></a>
<img src="images/i_p305.jpg" width="250" height="281" alt="Marble Head of a Boy," />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 72.</span>—Marble Head of a Boy, found
near the Akropolis, Sparta. In
Private Possession in Philadelphia,
U. S. A.</span>
</span>
Akropolis at Sparta in 1908 (Fig.
72). This head was for a time
in the University Museum, Philadelphia,
and later was exhibited
at the Boston Museum of Fine
Arts. At last accounts it was in
private possession in Philadelphia.
It has been published as
the head of a youthful Herakles
by my colleague, Professor W. N.
Bates, in the <i>American Journal
of Archæology</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2130"></a><a href="#Footnote_2130" class="fnanchor">2130</a> Of its style he
says: “The points of resemblance
which the Philadelphia
Heracles bears to the heads from
the Tegean pediments are so
many and so striking that they
must all be traced back to the
same sculptor; and that he was
Skopas there can be little doubt.”
He therefore concludes that it is
“probably a very good copy of a
lost work of Skopas.”<a id="FNanchor_2131"></a><a href="#Footnote_2131" class="fnanchor">2131</a> A little later, Dr. L. D. Caskey, of the
Museum in Boston, found these resemblances hardly close enough,
in view of the influence of Skopas on later Greek sculpture, to justify
so definite an attribution.<a id="FNanchor_2132"></a><a href="#Footnote_2132" class="fnanchor">2132</a> He found them confined to the upper part
of the face, while he believed that the lower portion resembled heads
which could be assigned to Praxiteles or his influence, and conse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">306</a></span>quently
he pronounced the head “an eclectic work in which features
borrowed from Skopas and Praxiteles have been combined with an
unusually successful effect.”</p>

<p>As Dr. Bates points out, there is no recorded statue of Herakles by
Skopas which corresponds with this head. The stone one mentioned
by Pausanias as standing in the Gymnasion at Sikyon<a id="FNanchor_2133"></a><a href="#Footnote_2133" class="fnanchor">2133</a> has been thought
by the authors of the <i>Numismatic Commentary on Pausanias</i> to be
reproduced on a Sikyonian copper coin of the age of Geta, now in the
British Museum.<a id="FNanchor_2134"></a><a href="#Footnote_2134" class="fnanchor">2134</a> Many statues and busts scattered in European museums,
which represent a beardless Herakles and show Skopaic influence,
have been traced back to this original.<a id="FNanchor_2135"></a><a href="#Footnote_2135" class="fnanchor">2135</a> However, the coin represents
the hero wearing a wreath, and so, if it was copied from the original in
the Gymnasion, the latter could not have been the prototype of the
head under discussion.</p>

<p>It is now universally acknowledged that all constructive criticism of
the art of Skopas must be based on a study of the heads found at Tegea.
Besides those discovered in 1879, and now in the National Museum
in Athens,<a id="FNanchor_2136"></a><a href="#Footnote_2136" class="fnanchor">2136</a> two other male heads (in addition to the torso of a female
figure draped as an Amazon, and a head on the same scale which probably
belongs to it, as both are of Parian marble, representing probably
<i>Atalanta</i> of the East pediment) were discovered by M. Mendel in his
excavations of the temple of Athena Alea in 1900–1901, and referred to
the pedimental groups described by Pausanias.<a id="FNanchor_2137"></a><a href="#Footnote_2137" class="fnanchor">2137</a> As one of these (Fig.73)
is characterized by a lion’s scalp worn as a helmet, the hero’s face
fitting into the jaws, its teeth showing above his forehead, it has been
regarded as the head from a statue of Herakles, although Pausanias
mentions no such statue in his enumeration of the figures composing the
group of the Eastern pediment, and although it is difficult to explain
the presence of the hero in the group of the Western pediment, which
represented the battle between his son Telephos and Achilles. Mendel
considers this head to be inferior in workmanship to the others, and so
refers it to the school of Skopas rather than to the master himself, and
designates it “<i>un travail d’atelier</i>.” In describing it, however, he
says: “<i>tous ces caractères, qui sont ceux des têtes du Musée central, se<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">307</a></span>
retrouvent dans nôtre tête d’Héraclés</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_2138"></a><a href="#Footnote_2138" class="fnanchor">2138</a> Here we have a head of a
youthful Herakles (or of some hero who has borrowed his attribute of
the lion’s skin—perhaps Telephos), which, if not by Skopas himself,
is still a work of his school reproducing all his characteristics; consequently,
of all these heads from Tegea, it is with this one chiefly
that we should compare the head from Sparta similarly covered with a
lion’s scalp.</p>

Tegea, by Skopas. National Museum,

</div>

<p>Though badly injured, it is still possible to see in this head of the
so-called <i>Herakles</i> found at Tegea, both in full view and in profile, the
characteristic Skopaic expression of passion, and to discover the means
by which the artist effected it. The expression is due in great measure
to the upward direction of the gaze, and to the heavy overshadowing
of the deep-set eyes. It is further enhanced by the contracted brow,
dilated nostril, and half-open, almost panting, mouth, whose parted lips
clearly disclose the teeth. The structure of the head is in keeping
with the strength of character portrayed; the skull is very deep from
front to back, and its framework is massive and bony; the face is broad
and short and the chin is heavy; everything emphasizes the impression
of a virile and muscular warrior violently engaged in the fray. The
subjects of the two pedimental groups—the Kalydonian boar hunt and
the battle between Achilles and Telephos—justified the expression of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">308</a></span>
unrestrained violence which we see in this and the other male heads,
and gave the sculptor an opportunity to represent his heroes in the
excitement of action and danger. To effect this intensity of expression
Skopas relied mainly on the treatment of the eye. In one of the heads
(the unhelmeted one in Athens) the gaze is not turned upwards as in the
<i>Herakles</i>, nor are the neck-muscles strained as in the others, and yet
the expression is even more violent than in them. Thus it is the modeling
of the flesh about the eye which is the real distinguishing feature
of Skopas’ work. In describing the helmeted head in Athens, E. A.
Gardner says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The eyes are set very deep in their sockets, and heavily overshadowed, at
their inner corners, by the strong projection of the brow, which does not,
however, as in some later examples of a similar intention on the part of the
artist, meet the line of the nose at an acute angle, but arches away from it in a
bold curve. At the outer corners the eyes are also heavily overshadowed, here
by a projecting mass of flesh or muscle which overhangs and actually hides in
part the upper lid. The eyes are very wide-open—with a dilation which
comes from fixing the eyes upon a distant object—and therefore suggest the
far-away look associated with a passionate nature.”<a id="FNanchor_2139"></a><a href="#Footnote_2139" class="fnanchor">2139</a></p></blockquote>

<h3>COMPARISON OF THE TEGEA HEADS AND THE
HEAD FROM SPARTA.</h3>

<p>It is to the facial characteristics in the Tegea heads that Dr. Bates
calls attention in basing his argument for the Skopaic origin of the head
from Sparta: the forehead horizontally divided by a median line, the
swelling, prominent brow, the deep-set eyes with their narrow lids—only
2 mm. wide—embedded in the projecting flesh at the outer corners,
and the parted mouth. He also sees a resemblance in the small
round curls bunched together above the ears. But if there are resemblances
(especially in the modeling of the eyes) there are also great
differences observable in the Tegea heads and the one from Sparta.
Let us confine our comparison of the latter with the <i>Herakles</i> of the
Tegea pediment, though the comparison with any of the other male
heads would lead to substantially the same results.</p>

<p>In the first place the structure of the two heads in question is very
different. As the head from Sparta is broken in two at the ears and the
whole back part is missing, we can not tell whether it had the great
depth of the one from Tegea. But of the massive, bony framework of the
latter there is little trace in the former. In the Tegea example we are
struck with the squareness of the head and the breadth of the central
part of the face; the sides do not gradually converge toward the middle,
but seem to form distinct planes. The distance between the eyes is
also in keeping with the breadth of the skull as measured between the
ears; the breadth of the face almost equals its length from the top of
the forehead to the chin, and this fact, together with the massive, promi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">309</a></span>nent
chin, gives an element of squareness to the whole.<a id="FNanchor_2140"></a><a href="#Footnote_2140" class="fnanchor">2140</a> On the other
hand, the head from Sparta has a long, narrow face whose sides softly
converge toward the middle in beautiful curves about the cheeks; its
cheek-bones are not so high nor so prominent as those of the other; it
ends in a delicate, almost effeminate chin, which slightly retreats and
gives the whole lower part of the face an oval structure, thus recalling
Praxiteles and fourth-century Attic works. The length of the face is
accentuated by the considerable height to which the head rises above
the forehead, in contrast with the flatness of the skull in the example
from Tegea. The eyes are not so wide-open; they are longer and not
so swollen nor compressed toward the centre; if we view the two heads
from the side, we see that the eye-socket in the Tegea head is larger and
appreciably deeper than in the one from Sparta.</p>

<p>Apart from these surface differences in the structure of the head and
face, it is in the resultant expression that we see the greatest divergence
from the Skopaic type. This seems to me to be fundamentally different
in the Sparta head. In the <i>Herakles</i>, as in all the other Tegea male
heads, and even in those of the boar and the dogs, the really characteristic
feature, which differentiates them from all other works of Greek
sculpture, is the passionate intensity of their expression. The one
unforgettable impression left on the spectator by them all is this
expression of violent and unrestrained passion, which the sculptor has
succeeded in imparting to the marble. This is what marks him as the
master of passion and the originator of the dramatic tendencies carried
to such lengths in the Hellenistic schools of sculpture; it is this which
explains Kallistratos’ characterization of his works as being κάτοχα καὶ
μεστὰ μανίας.<a id="FNanchor_2141"></a><a href="#Footnote_2141" class="fnanchor">2141</a> The head from Sparta shows only a little of this intensity.
Notwithstanding the similar upward gaze and slightly parted lips, the
intention of the artist seems to have been to portray the hero in an attitude
of expectancy, tempered by a look almost of calmness. The look
is deeply earnest, but not violent; it is even melancholy. It is this last
feature, the delicate and compelling melancholy of the face, which
impressed me most on first viewing it. This is further enhanced by
the full, soft modeling of the lower face, that gives to the whole a delicate,
almost effeminate character, which strongly reminds us of Praxitelean
heads. In fact, the shape of the lips and the modeling of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">310</a></span>
flesh on either side of the mouth, together with the soft, dimpled chin,
have little in common with the massive strength and remarkable animation
of the Tegea heads. As Dr. Caskey has intimated, if we had
only the lower portion of the face for comparison, we should be inclined
to ascribe it to the influence of Praxiteles. If we considered the upper
part only, resemblances to Skopaic work seem well marked; but if we
take into account the expression of the face as a whole, we see that it lacks
the most essential of Skopaic features, the look of passionate intensity.
Consequently we shall find it difficult to bring the head into such close
relation to that artist; for here there is little analogy to the vigorous
warrior types of the Tegea pediments. For its quieter mien it might be
better to compare it with the head of Atalanta,<a id="FNanchor_2142"></a><a href="#Footnote_2142" class="fnanchor">2142</a> though none of the gentle
pathos or eagerness of the Sparta head is there visible. The <i>Atalanta</i>,
though full of vigorous life, utterly lacks the unrestrained passion so
characteristic of her brothers; her eyes are not so deeply set, nor so wide-open;
they are narrower and longer, and are not over-hung at the outer
corners by heavy masses of flesh.<a id="FNanchor_2143"></a><a href="#Footnote_2143" class="fnanchor">2143</a> In speaking of the absence of these
rolls of muscle, E. A. Gardner notes a curious peculiarity: “This is
a clearly marked, though delicately rounded, roll of flesh between the
brow and the upper eyelid, which is continued right round above the
inner corner of the eye, to join the swelling at the side of the nose,
which itself passes on into the cheek.”<a id="FNanchor_2144"></a><a href="#Footnote_2144" class="fnanchor">2144</a> He detects this same peculi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">311</a></span>arity
in certain other Skopaic heads, notably in the <i>Apollo</i> from the Mausoleion
and the <i>Demeter</i> from Knidos, though it is quite lacking in the
Tegea male heads. It all goes to show that Skopas was not strictly consistent
in his treatment of the eye. The lower face of the <i>Atalanta</i> is also
longer and more oval than that of the male heads, and thus shows Attic
rather than Peloponnesian influence. If it is difficult, then, to conceive
of the <i>Atalanta</i> and the male heads as the work of the same sculptor, the
contrast, both in structure and expression, between these two heads of
Herakles, the one from Tegea, the other from Sparta, makes it more
difficult to assume the same authorship for both; for here we can not
explain the difference as the contrast between the types of hero and
heroine; here we are comparing two heads which are supposedly of the
same hero.</p>

<h3>THE STYLES OF SKOPAS AND LYSIPPOS COMPARED.</h3>

Museum, Athens.</div>
</div>

<p>In view, then, of the differences enumerated I should hesitate to
assign a Skopaic origin to the head from Sparta. In the lower part of
the face, with its small mouth and delicate chin, I see signs only of
Praxitelean influence; in the upper part I am much more inclined to
see affinities to the art-tendencies of Lysippos, as we now know them
from the statue of Agias. In the present state of our knowledge it is
not difficult to separate works of Praxitelean origin from those of Skopas;
but it is a very different thing to distinguish those of Skopaic
origin from those of Lysippos; here the line distinguishing the two masters
is much finer and harder to draw. Before the discovery of the
Tegea heads, the deep-set eye,<a id="FNanchor_2145"></a><a href="#Footnote_2145" class="fnanchor">2145</a> prominent brow, and “breathing” mouth
were looked upon as characteristic features of Lysippos, as they were
known to us from representations of Alexander, especially on coins.
We now know that these traits belonged to Skopas to a much greater
extent. When the <i>Agias</i> was found, and before its true authorship had
been determined, Homolle, as we have seen, had at first classed it
as showing the manner of Lysippos, only later to see more of Skopas
than Lysippos in it. Such a conclusion was natural so long as we
regarded the <i>Apoxyomenos</i> as the key to Lysippan art. By assigning
these traits definitely to Skopas, we were compelled to view the work of
Lysippos as conventional and somewhat lifeless in comparison. But
with the assumption that the statue of Agias represented true Lysippan
characteristics, we were forced to recognize that the same traits
belonged to Lysippos also, though to a less degree, since the energy of
the Tegea heads was absent from the features of the <i>Agias</i> and their
fierceness was here replaced by a look of quiet melancholy. The study
of such allied works as the beautiful and excellently preserved <i>Lansdowne
Herakles</i> (Pl. <a href="#p30">30</a> and Fig. <a href="#f71">71</a>), the athlete on the Pentelic marble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">312</a></span>
stele found in the bed of the Ilissos in 1874, and now in the National
Museum in Athens (Fig. <a href="#f74">74</a>),<a id="FNanchor_2146"></a><a href="#Footnote_2146" class="fnanchor">2146</a> the so-called <i>Meleager</i> in the Vatican
(Fig. <a href="#f75">75</a>),<a id="FNanchor_2147"></a><a href="#Footnote_2147" class="fnanchor">2147</a> and other copies of the same original (<i>e. g.</i>, Figs. 76, 77), also
shows how closely the type of Lysippos approached that of Skopas.
Long ago I expressed the view<a id="FNanchor_2148"></a><a href="#Footnote_2148" class="fnanchor">2148</a> that these and similar works should be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">313</a></span>
assigned to Lysippos rather than to Skopas, to whom most critics had
referred them. Thus, after the discovery of the Tegea heads, scholarly
opinion began to follow the arguments of Furtwaengler in bringing
the <i>Lansdowne Herakles</i> into the sphere of Skopas.<a id="FNanchor_2149"></a><a href="#Footnote_2149" class="fnanchor">2149</a> But Michaelis,

short neck in comparison with the
mighty shoulders, and long legs in
proportion to the thick-set torso,
had declared: “Without doubt the
statue offers one of the finest specimens,
if not absolutely the best, of
a Herakles according to the conception
of Lysippos.”<a id="FNanchor_2150"></a><a href="#Footnote_2150" class="fnanchor">2150</a> Now opinion
varies again; only those who believe
that the <i>Agias</i> is Lysippan class the
<i>Herakles</i> as a Lysippan work.<a id="FNanchor_2151"></a><a href="#Footnote_2151" class="fnanchor">2151</a> Of
the <i>Meleager</i>, Graef<a id="FNanchor_2152"></a><a href="#Footnote_2152" class="fnanchor">2152</a> gives eighteen
copies besides the one in the Vatican.
This number shows how common an
adornment it was of Roman villas
and parks. Some of these copies
have a chlamys thrown over the
arm, <i>e. g.</i>, the Vatican example,
and belong to imperial times, while
others without the mantle, <i>e. g.</i>, the
torso in Berlin,<a id="FNanchor_2153"></a><a href="#Footnote_2153" class="fnanchor">2153</a> are older. In addition
to the Vatican example we reproduce
two other copies, the beautiful
Parian marble head now placed on
the trunk of a Praxitelean <i>Apollo</i>
in the gardens of the Medici in Rome
(Fig. <a href="#f76">76</a>),<a id="FNanchor_2154"></a><a href="#Footnote_2154" class="fnanchor">2154</a> and the statue without

be Lysippan, being identified with the <i>Venator</i> at Thespiai mentioned
by Pliny as the work of Euthykrates, the son and pupil of  Lysippos,<a id="FNanchor_2156"></a><a href="#Footnote_2156" class="fnanchor">2156</a>

<p>Let us analyze a little further wherein the difference between the
closely allied art of Skopas and Lysippos lies. We saw that it was
chiefly the formation of the eye and its surroundings which characterized

<img src="images/i_p315.jpg" width="250" height="398" alt="Torso of the so-called

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 77.</span>—Torso of the so-called
<i>Meleager</i>. Fogg Art Museum,
Cambridge, U. S. A.</span></span>
Skopaic work—the depth of the
balls in their sockets, and the heavy
masses of flesh above the outer corners.
This was in harmony with
the breadth of brow and the massive
build of the Tegea heads. In
the <i>Agias</i> and similar works the
treatment of the eye is somewhat
different. The head of the <i>Agias</i>
is of slighter proportions than the
heads from Tegea; in conformity
with the Lysippan canon it is below
life-size, and consequently has no
such heavy overshadowing of the
outer corners of the eyes. Moreover,
as we shall see, this overshadowing
is also relatively less in
the statue of the Delphian athlete.
The formation of the eye is thus
described by E. A. Gardner:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The inner corners of the eye are
set very deep in the head and very
close together; the inner corners of the
eye-sockets form acute angles, running
up close to one another and leaving between
them only a narrow ridge for the
base of the nose; thus they offer a strong
contrast to the line of the brow, arching
away in a broad curve from the solid base of the nose and forming an
obtuse angle with it, such as we see in the Skopaic heads.”<a id="FNanchor_2159"></a><a href="#Footnote_2159" class="fnanchor">2159</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The resultant expression is therefore somewhat different from that
of the heads from Tegea; while we still see animation and even intensity
in the face of the <i>Agias</i>, we see it in a modified degree. The far-away
look of the Tegea heads is still present, but it appears to be fixed
on a nearer object, and so the look of intensity is tempered; it is also
lightened by the fact that the overshadowing of the eyes at the outer
corners is less heavy. But even this latter so-called Skopaic trait, though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">316</a></span>
it is absent in the <i>Agias</i>, is certainly present in other Lysippan heads.
Besides being prominent in representations of Alexander the Great on
coins,<a id="FNanchor_2160"></a><a href="#Footnote_2160" class="fnanchor">2160</a> it is seen in busts of the conqueror, especially in the splendid one
from Alexandria in the British Museum.<a id="FNanchor_2161"></a><a href="#Footnote_2161" class="fnanchor">2161</a> In the latter example we see
just such heavy rolls of flesh as we note in the Skopaic heads. It shows
that this trait, introduced by Skopas, was used at times with equal effect
by Lysippos. We have already noted how in one example, at least, Skopas
himself laid it aside—in the <i>Atalanta</i>. Its presence on Lysippan
heads shows that too much stress can be laid on this feature in deciding
whether a given piece of sculpture is to be referred to Skopas.
This trait complicates the whole problem of the style of the two masters.</p>

<h3>THE SPARTA HEAD COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE
PHILANDRIDAS.</h3>

<p>As the <i>Agias</i> is considered by most critics to be a contemporary copy
of the original statue at Pharsalos, perhaps it will be more just to compare
the head from Sparta under discussion with the original marble
head from Olympia, which we have ascribed in the earlier part of the
present chapter to the statue of Philandridas by Lysippos. Such a
comparison will, of course, show certain differences, but marked resemblances
as well. We shall see that these resemblances are confined to the
upper part of the face. In both we note the same low forehead with a
corresponding depression or crease across the middle; the similarly
bulging brow which breaks very perceptibly the continuous line from
forehead to nose, concave above and below and convex at the swelling
itself; the same powerfully framed and deep-set eyes thrown into shadows
by the projecting bony structure of the brows and the overhanging
masses of flesh. The eyeballs in both are similarly long and narrow,
though they are slightly arched in the <i>Philandridas</i> just as in the Tegea
heads, and not so close together as in the <i>Agias</i>, but their inner angles are
farther apart and not almost hidden by the flat bridge of the nose when
viewed straight from the front. In this respect they are strikingly like
those of the Sparta head.<a id="FNanchor_2162"></a><a href="#Footnote_2162" class="fnanchor">2162</a> The raised upper lids in both form symmetri<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">317</a></span>cally
narrow and sharply defined borders over the eyeballs. These
borders, in each case, are not partially hidden by the folds of skin at
the outer corners, as they are in the Tegea heads; and yet the masses
of flesh projecting from the brows are almost as heavy as in the latter.
In both the heads from Olympia and Sparta the upper lids slightly
overlap the under at the outer corners. The eye-sockets in both seem
to be equally deep and the cheek-bones similarly high and prominent.
We remark in the <i>Philandridas</i> the gradual converging of the sides of
the face toward the middle, a trait which we have already observed in
the head from Sparta as in contrast with the more angular formation
with lateral planes so characteristic of the Tegea male heads. The
flatness of the nose and the curves which it makes with the brow on
either side are very similar in the two heads under discussion. In both,
the hair is treated in the same simple and sketchy manner, being fashioned
into little ringlets ruffled back from the temples in flat relief quite
in the Skopaic manner, even if the curls seem shorter and more tense.</p>

<p>When we come to a consideration of the lower part of each face, we
immediately detect differences. While both faces end in an oval,
this is broader, heavier, and more bony in that of the <i>Philandridas</i>,
as we should expect in the case of a more mature man. Consequently
here the mouth is larger and firmer. The elegant contour of the lips
observable in the <i>Agias</i> is also found, to a less degree, in the head
from Sparta, whose lips are fuller and more sensuous, but can not be
traced in the <i>Philandridas</i> owing to the damaged condition of the mouth.
It is clear, however, that the lips of the latter were also slightly parted,
just showing the teeth, but not as in the Tegea heads, as if the breath
were being forced through them with great effort.</p>

<p>It is, however, in the expression of these two faces that we see the
greatest resemblance. In the <i>Philandridas</i>, the powerful framing of
the eyes, the slightly upward gaze of the balls, and the contracted
forehead combine to give it a pensive, even melancholy, look of dignity,
a look seemingly of one who takes no joy or pleasure in victory,
though, as we have already mentioned,<a id="FNanchor_2163"></a><a href="#Footnote_2163" class="fnanchor">2163</a> it is earnest rather than
mournful. The almost identical treatment of the eye and its surroundings
gives the still more youthful head from Sparta a similar
expression. Homolle’s analysis of the expression of the face of the
<i>Agias</i> would apply with equal fitness to the mood portrayed in both
the heads we are discussing: “<i>L’expression qui résulte de ces divers traits,
c’est, dans une figure jeune et vigoureuse, un air pensif ou lassé, une
certaine mélancolie, qui ne va pas à la tristesse morne ou à la méditation
profonde, mais qui reste plus loin encore de la joie insouciante de
la vie et de la pure allégresse de la victoire</i>”.<a id="FNanchor_2164"></a><a href="#Footnote_2164" class="fnanchor">2164</a> Preuner remarked that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">318</a></span>
a verse of the epigram found on the base of the statue of Agias,
which runs καὶ σῶν οὐδείς πω στῆσε τροπαῖα χερῶν, is almost an exact
copy of the words of Herakles in the <i>Trachiniae</i> of Sophocles.<a id="FNanchor_2165"></a><a href="#Footnote_2165" class="fnanchor">2165</a> In these
words the dedicator of the statue ends the recital of his ancestor’s
exploits with a melancholy reflection on the vanity of his glory.
They suggest with no less truth the expression of both the heads we
are discussing. This expression of pensiveness tinged with melancholy
is enhanced in both by the slightly parted lips. We can see
the same expression carried much further in many of the portraits of
Alexander which go back to originals by Lysippos, and we know from
Plutarch that this sculptor was chosen by the conqueror to make his
portraits, because Lysippos alone could combine his manly air with
the liquid and melting glance of his eyes.<a id="FNanchor_2166"></a><a href="#Footnote_2166" class="fnanchor">2166</a> But how different is the
delicately indicated pathos of these heads from the violent and unrestrained,
even panting, expression of the Tegea sculptures! Here
there is no trace of the μανία which Kallistratos said characterized
the works of Skopas. If it be objected that the expression of the
<i>Philandridas</i> is more dramatic than that of the head from Sparta, its
fierce, almost barbarous, look of defiance may well be explained by
the fact that here is represented a victor from Akarnania, a country
noted among the other Greek states for anything but culture and
refinement.</p>

<h3>THE SPARTA HEAD AN ECLECTIC WORK AND AN EXAMPLE
OF ASSIMILATION.</h3>

<p>It is, then, in consequence of these resemblances to Lysippan work,
and because of the differences between it and the Tegean heads, that I
am led to see more of Lysippos than of Skopas in this beautiful head
from Sparta. An analysis of its style permits us to discover in it the
mixed influences of Praxiteles, of Lysippos, and of Skopas. It seems
to me necessary, therefore, in view of this mixture of tendencies, to
regard it as an eclectic work, in which the unknown artist has combined
Lysippan and Praxitelean elements chiefly; and that he was also under
the influence of Skopas is evinced by the peculiarities mentioned in the
treatment of the eyes and hair;<a id="FNanchor_2167"></a><a href="#Footnote_2167" class="fnanchor">2167</a> but even in the modeling of the eyes,
I believe that his chief debt was to Lysippos. The fineness of surface
modeling, commented on by both Professor Bates and Dr. Caskey,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">319</a></span>recalls the delicacy of execution in detail which is mentioned by Pliny
as characteristic of Lysippan art.<a id="FNanchor_2168"></a><a href="#Footnote_2168" class="fnanchor">2168</a> It surely points to a date for the
work not much if at all later than the end of the century which was
made glorious in the history of sculpture by the labors of these three
great masters.</p>

<p>In the preceding account I have tacitly assumed with Professor Bates
that the head from Sparta represents a beardless Herakles. But, as
Dr. Caskey remarks, one might hesitate to accept this identification
if it were not for the attribute of the lion’s skin above the forehead, for
here there is little indication of the strength so characteristic of later
representations of the hero. Dr. Caskey, however, observes that a
head of Herakles, now in the British Museum, which some have
regarded as an original by Praxiteles, is even more boyish than this
one. However, it is very doubtful if the Sparta head should be referred
to a statue of Herakles at all. Pausanias mentions only three statues
of Herakles in Sparta, to any one of which it seems futile to try to refer
the head under discussion; thus in III, 14.6, he speaks of an ἄγαλμα
ἀρχαῖον to which the <i>Sphairians</i>, <i>i. e.</i>, lads entering on manhood, sacrificed,
as standing on the road to the Δρόμος, outside the city walls; in
the same book, 14.8, he says that an image of the hero stood at the end
of one of the two bridges across the moat to Plane-tree Grove, <i>i. e.</i>,
the boys’ exercise-ground; and again in this book, 15.3, he says that an
ἄγαλμα ὡπλισμένον of Herakles stood in the Herakleion close to the
city wall, whose attitude (σχῆμα), was suggested by the battle between
the hero and Hippokoön and his sons. The same writer enumerates
only three other statues of Herakles in Lakonia. One of these was in
the market-place of Gythion (III, 21.8), another in front of the walls of
Las beyond Gythion (III, 24.6), and the third on Mount Parnon near the
boundaries of Argolis, Lakonia, and Tegea (III, 10.6). The head under
discussion is more probably only one more example of the idealizing
tendency of athletic Greek art, which assimilated the type of victor to
that of god.<a id="FNanchor_2169"></a><a href="#Footnote_2169" class="fnanchor">2169</a> In the case of the <i>Agias</i> the sculptor plainly wished to
raise the victor to the ideal height of the hero. The same idealization
is visible in the head ascribed to the statue of Philandridas. In both
these heads the ears, while small, are battered and swollen; the
remains of the ears in the head from Sparta are too badly damaged to
indicate whether these were swollen or not. But even if they were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">320</a></span>
preserved and were in that condition, they would not be a distinguishing
factor in determining whether the head belonged to the statue of a
victor or of Herakles. In our consideration of the Olympia head we
saw by a comparison with the <i>Lansdowne Herakles</i>, a statue universally
recognized as that of the hero, how fundamentally different were
the two in their whole conception and how differently a highly idealized
athlete and a hero were treated by the same sculptor. The same
might be said of the boyish head from Sparta, when compared with
a genuine head of Herakles. For this reason, and because of the
resemblance in expression between the <i>Philandridas</i> and the head
from Sparta, I am inclined to believe that the latter, instead of being
a representation of a youthful Herakles, is really the idealized portrait
of an athlete, probably that of a boy victor, either in the boxing or
wrestling match,<a id="FNanchor_2170"></a><a href="#Footnote_2170" class="fnanchor">2170</a> assimilated in form to that of the hero.<a id="FNanchor_2171"></a><a href="#Footnote_2171" class="fnanchor">2171</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>THE MATERIALS OF OLYMPIC VICTOR MONUMENTS, AND THE
OLDEST DATED VICTOR STATUE.<a id="FNanchor_2172"></a><a href="#Footnote_2172" class="fnanchor">2172</a></small></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figures 78–80.</span></p>

<p>It has been assumed pretty generally by archæologists that the victor
statues set up in the Altis at Olympia were uniformly of bronze.
Scherer, in his inaugural dissertation <i>de olympionicarum Statuis</i>, which
appeared in 1885, was the first to discuss the question fully,<a id="FNanchor_2173"></a><a href="#Footnote_2173" class="fnanchor">2173</a> and his
arguments and conclusions have been followed, for the most part, by
later investigators. Thus Dittenberger and Purgold state unequivocally
that these statues were “<i>ausnahmslos aus Bronze</i>”,<a id="FNanchor_2174"></a><a href="#Footnote_2174" class="fnanchor">2174</a> while more
recently Hitzig and Bluemner, in their great commentary on Pausanias,
have again pronounced the dictum that “<i>die Siegerstatuen waren durchweg
von Erz</i>”.<a id="FNanchor_2175"></a><a href="#Footnote_2175" class="fnanchor">2175</a> Others, however, have not been quite so sweeping
in their generalization. Thus Wolters believes that these statues,
because they were set up in the open, were “<i>der Regel nach</i>” of bronze,<a id="FNanchor_2176"></a><a href="#Footnote_2176" class="fnanchor">2176</a>
and Furtwaengler and Urlichs assume that they were “<i>fast ausschliesslich
aus Bronze</i>”.<a id="FNanchor_2177"></a><a href="#Footnote_2177" class="fnanchor">2177</a></p>

<h3>THE CASE FOR BRONZE.</h3>

<p>The arguments adduced by Scherer and others in defense of the contention
seem at first sight, although inferential in character, quite
conclusive. In the first place, it has been pointed out that all the
statuaries mentioned by Pausanias in his victor <i>periegesis</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2178"></a><a href="#Footnote_2178" class="fnanchor">2178</a> if recorded
at all in Pliny’s <i>Historia Naturalis</i>, appear there in the catalogue of
bronze founders as workers in bronze κατ’ ἐξοχήν, while none of them is
known exclusively as a sculptor in marble. As Hagelaïdas is the first
in point of time, who flourished from the third quarter of the sixth
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> to the second quarter of the fifth,<a id="FNanchor_2179"></a><a href="#Footnote_2179" class="fnanchor">2179</a> Scherer believed that all
statues from his date down—<i>posteriorum temporum</i>—were of bronze;
and as Rhoikos and Theodoros, the inventors of bronze founding, flourished
about Ols. 50 to 60 (&#8239;=&#8239;580 to 540 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>),<a id="FNanchor_2180"></a><a href="#Footnote_2180" class="fnanchor">2180</a> he believed that bronze<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">322</a></span>
might have been used up to their date. In the next place, the excavated
bases, which have been identified as those of victor monuments,
show footprints of bronze statues. Thirdly, actual bronze fragments,
indubitably belonging to victor statues (of which two are attested by
inscriptions), were found during the excavations of the Altis. These
consist of the following:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) An inscribed convex piece of bronze of imperial times, “<i>anscheinend
vom Schenkel einer Bronzestatue herruehrend</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_2181"></a><a href="#Footnote_2181" class="fnanchor">2181</a></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A similar inscribed fragment of the same period.<a id="FNanchor_2182"></a><a href="#Footnote_2182" class="fnanchor">2182</a></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The remarkable life-size portrait head of a boxer or pancratiast,
which we have already discussed and reproduced (Fig. 61 A and B).<a id="FNanchor_2183"></a><a href="#Footnote_2183" class="fnanchor">2183</a></p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) A foot of masterly workmanship (Fig. <a href="#f62">62</a>) ascribed by Furtwaengler<a id="FNanchor_2184"></a><a href="#Footnote_2184" class="fnanchor">2184</a>
to the end of the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> Its position shows
that the statue of which it was a part was represented in motion, and
consequently it has been assigned to a victor statue.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) A beautifully modeled right arm, somewhat under life-size, supposedly
from the statue of a boy victor.<a id="FNanchor_2185"></a><a href="#Footnote_2185" class="fnanchor">2185</a></p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) A right lower leg of excellent workmanship, assigned by Furtwaengler
to the same period as fragment <i>e</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2186"></a><a href="#Footnote_2186" class="fnanchor">2186</a></p>

<p>Still other bronze fragments of statues found at Olympia may
have belonged to statues of victors, especially to those of boys.<a id="FNanchor_2187"></a><a href="#Footnote_2187" class="fnanchor">2187</a>
The small number of such fragments recovered—Scherer wrongly
thought there was none—is explained by assuming that all of these
statues were of bronze, and consequently were destroyed by the barbarians
in their inroads into Greece during the early Middle Ages,
when this metal was much prized.<a id="FNanchor_2188"></a><a href="#Footnote_2188" class="fnanchor">2188</a> Another argument for believing
that these statues were of bronze is the silence of Pausanias concerning
the materials employed in them; for, in his enumeration of
192 such monuments, he mentions the material of only two statues,
those of the boxer Praxidamas of Aegina<a id="FNanchor_2189"></a><a href="#Footnote_2189" class="fnanchor">2189</a> and of the Opuntian pancratiast
Rhexibios,<a id="FNanchor_2190"></a><a href="#Footnote_2190" class="fnanchor">2190</a> and he mentions these because of their great
antiquity, peculiar position in the Altis apart from the others (near<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">323</a></span>
the column of Oinomaos), and the fact that they were made of
wood.<a id="FNanchor_2191"></a><a href="#Footnote_2191" class="fnanchor">2191</a> Furthermore, in his book on <i>Achaia</i> there occurs this passage
in reference to the statue of the victor Promachos, which was set up in
the Gymnasion of Pellene: καὶ αὐτοῦ [Προμάχου] καὶ εἰκόνας ποιήσαντες
οἱ Πελληνεῖς τὴν μὲν ἐς Ὀλυμπίαν ἀνέθεσαν, τὴν δὲ ἐν τῷ γυμνασίῳ, λίθου
ταύτην καὶ οὐ χαλκοῦ.<a id="FNanchor_2192"></a><a href="#Footnote_2192" class="fnanchor">2192</a> Most critics have inferred from these last words,
“<i>the one in the Gymnasion being of stone and not of bronze</i>,” that, although
Pausanias says nothing about the material of statues of victors in the
Altis (barring the two just mentioned), by implication all these statues
were of bronze; and they point out the fact that other writers furnish
no evidence concerning the material used in them—an argument <i>ex
silentio</i> to the same effect. Besides these arguments many others have
been urged on purely a priori grounds; <i>e. g.</i>, that, since these statues
stood in the open air, subject to all kinds of weathering, they must
have been made of bronze;<a id="FNanchor_2193"></a><a href="#Footnote_2193" class="fnanchor">2193</a> that metal statues would have been cheaper
and more easily prepared than those of marble;<a id="FNanchor_2194"></a><a href="#Footnote_2194" class="fnanchor">2194</a> that the later Peloponnesian
schools of athletic sculpture, which were characterized by
their predilection for bronze-founding, would nowhere have been more
prominently in evidence than at Olympia; etc.</p>

<p>Thus the case for the use of metal in these statues seems very well
substantiated, and, for the reasons given, it can not be reasonably
doubted that the vast majority of these monuments were made of
bronze. But that they were not exclusively of metal, and that there
were many exceptions to the general rule, not only can be conjectured
on good grounds, but can be proved by discoveries made at the excavations.
We shall briefly consider, then, each of the foregoing
arguments in turn, and see whether, in the light of the accumulated
evidence, they are really as well founded as they appear to be.</p>

<h3>THE CASE FOR STONE.</h3>

<p>As for the first point, that the statuaries mentioned by Pausanias
appear only in Pliny’s catalogue of bronze founders, we must remember
that Pausanias himself says<a id="FNanchor_2195"></a><a href="#Footnote_2195" class="fnanchor">2195</a> that he is making only a selection of the
victor monuments in the Altis, those of the more famous athletes.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">324</a></span>
Therefore, the 192 monuments (of 187 victors)<a id="FNanchor_2196"></a><a href="#Footnote_2196" class="fnanchor">2196</a> which he does mention
must be only a fraction of the multitude of such monuments which
once stood at Olympia. Pliny, to be sure, says that it was the custom for
all victors to set up statues in the Altis;<a id="FNanchor_2197"></a><a href="#Footnote_2197" class="fnanchor">2197</a> but this refers only to the privilege,
of which many victors could not or did not avail themselves on
account of poverty, early death, or for other reasons.<a id="FNanchor_2198"></a><a href="#Footnote_2198" class="fnanchor">2198</a> Still, the number
of such dedications must have been very great. Manifestly, therefore,
we should not base an argument on the number mentioned. There
must, then, have been many other artists employed at Olympia, some
of whom may well have been workers in marble. Besides, of the statuaries
actually named by Pausanias, many do not appear at all in
Pliny’s work, and many of these may have been sculptors exclusively
in stone. Of the names found in Pliny, six at least—Kalamis, Kanachos,
Eutychides, Myron, Polykles, and Timarchides—appear both
in the list of bronze-workers and in that of marble-sculptors.<a id="FNanchor_2199"></a><a href="#Footnote_2199" class="fnanchor">2199</a> Similarly,
in answer to the second argument that the excavated bases show
footprints of bronze statues, we must admit that only a fraction of the
bases which once supported statues in the Altis have been recovered.
Not one-fifth of the victors mentioned by Pausanias are known to us
through these bases.<a id="FNanchor_2200"></a><a href="#Footnote_2200" class="fnanchor">2200</a></p>

<p>The fact that actual remains of bronze statues have been excavated
at Olympia is matched by the fact that remnants of marble statues have
also been found; and it does not seem reasonable, in the light of the
evidence adduced by Treu, Furtwaengler, and others, to reject these
as fragments of actual victor statues. These fragments include the
following:<a id="FNanchor_2201"></a><a href="#Footnote_2201" class="fnanchor">2201</a></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) The two life-size archaic helmeted heads (Fig. <a href="#f30">30</a>) which we
have ascribed to hoplite victors.<a id="FNanchor_2202"></a><a href="#Footnote_2202" class="fnanchor">2202</a></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>) Fragments of statues of boy victors: <i>c</i> = trunk with left
upper leg, three-fifths life-size (Fig. <a href="#f78">78</a>);<a id="FNanchor_2203"></a><a href="#Footnote_2203" class="fnanchor">2203</a> <i>d</i> = breast, one-half life-size;<a id="FNanchor_2204"></a><a href="#Footnote_2204" class="fnanchor">2204</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">325</a></span></p>

<p><i>e</i> = upper part of legs of a statue, two-thirds life-size.<a id="FNanchor_2205"></a><a href="#Footnote_2205" class="fnanchor">2205</a> Besides these
Treu also adduces fragments of four different boy statues, all of which
are less than life-size.<a id="FNanchor_2206"></a><a href="#Footnote_2206" class="fnanchor">2206</a></p>

<p>The reticence of Pausanias as to the material used in these statues
<span class="figright200"><a id="f78"></a>
<img src="images/i_p325.jpg" width="200" height="391" alt="Small Marble Torso

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 78.</span>—Small Marble Torso

Museum of Olympia.</span>
</span>
is merely in accord with his custom,
for he very rarely mentions the materials
of monuments, and apparently only
where monuments of bronze and stone
or other materials stand close together in a
circumscribed area, as for instance, in enumerating
the various monuments in the
Heraion at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_2207"></a><a href="#Footnote_2207" class="fnanchor">2207</a> The only inference,
therefore, to be drawn from Pausanias’
statement about the statue of
Promachos mentioned is that this particular
statue of a victor at Olympia was
of bronze. We are not justified in going
any further. Besides this stone statue at
Pellene we have other actual notices of
marble statues of Olympic victors outside
Olympia, as those of Arrhachion at Phigalia<a id="FNanchor_2208"></a><a href="#Footnote_2208" class="fnanchor">2208</a>
(Fig. <a href="#f79">79</a>) and of Agias by Lysippos
at Delphi (Pl. <a href="#p28">28</a> and Fig. <a href="#f68">68</a>). If
they existed outside Olympia, there is no
reason why they should not have existed
in the Altis also, <i>e. g.</i>, the Lysippan marble
head found there, which we assigned
in the preceding chapter to the Akarnanian
victor Philandridas (Frontispiece,
and Fig. <a href="#f69">69</a>). Many of the older statues,
like that of Arrhachion, conformed with the “Apollo” type, as we
have shown in Ch. III,<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> and doubtless many such at Olympia were
of marble.</p>

<p>Reinach’s argument that stone statues in Greece, because of their
patina of color, were intended to be placed under cover in the porticoes
or cellas of temples and elsewhere, while bronze ones were meant to
stand in the open air, has been sufficiently combatted by H. Lechat,<a id="FNanchor_2209"></a><a href="#Footnote_2209" class="fnanchor">2209</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">326</a></span>
who argues that the use of paint in Greek architecture and on temple
sculptures proves the contrary. As the paint was burnt in, it was
reasonably durable, and if it did not prove so it was readily renewed.
At Olympia, among several examples, we may cite the marble <i>Nike</i>
of Paionios, which stood in the open in the space to the east of the temple
of Zeus<a id="FNanchor_2210"></a><a href="#Footnote_2210" class="fnanchor">2210</a> (see Plans A and B), while, on the other hand, a bronze
statue of Aphrodite stood within the Heraion.<a id="FNanchor_2211"></a><a href="#Footnote_2211" class="fnanchor">2211</a> The argument that
metal statues were cheaper than marble must also be questioned.<a id="FNanchor_2212"></a><a href="#Footnote_2212" class="fnanchor">2212</a>
In the earlier part of the present work we saw that, for economy’s
sake, many victors set up small bronze statuettes instead of statues at
Olympia, numbers of which have been recovered. That such dedications
were common elsewhere is shown by the countless athlete statuettes—especially
diskoboloi—which are to be found in all European
museums.<a id="FNanchor_2213"></a><a href="#Footnote_2213" class="fnanchor">2213</a> For similar reasons victors would choose in place of bronze
the less durable and cheaper stone, as in the cases of Arrhachion and
Promachos cited, or even wood, as in those of Rhexibios and Praxidamas.
Still others, especially boy victors, would set up small marble
statues, two-fifths to two-thirds life-size, as the fragments of the seven
examples collected by Treu and already enumerated above show.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the contention that the victor statues at Olympia
were exclusively of bronze, in the light of the evidence adduced, is
untenable.</p>

<h3>THE STATUE OF ARRHACHION AT PHIGALIA.</h3>

<p>In his description of Arkadia, Pausanias mentions seeing the stone
statue of the pancratiast Arrhachion in the market-place of Phigalia.
He describes it as archaic, especially in pose, the feet being close together
and the arms hanging by the sides to the hips; and adds that he
was told that it once bore an inscription which had become illegible in
his day.<a id="FNanchor_2214"></a><a href="#Footnote_2214" class="fnanchor">2214</a> This Arrhachion won three victories at Olympia in the pan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">327</a></span>kration in Ols. 52–54 (&#8239;=&#8239;572–564 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_2215"></a><a href="#Footnote_2215" class="fnanchor">2215</a> Therefore his statue is one
of the oldest victor monuments of which we have record. At so early
a date, before individual types of victor statues had been developed, we
should expect, in harmony with the description of Pausanias, that this
statue would conform in style with the well-known archaic “Apollo”
type, the most characteristic of early Greek sculpture, which, as we
saw in Chapter III, is exemplified in the long series of statues found
all over the Greek world, the oldest class being represented by the
<span class="figright250"><a id="f79"></a>

</span>
example from Thera (Fig. <a href="#f9">9</a>), and one
of the youngest by that from Tenea
near Corinth (Pl. <a href="#p8A">8A</a>).</p>

<p>In his commentary on the passage
of Pausanias, Sir J. G. Frazer records
that during a visit in May, 1890,
he saw a recently discovered archaic
stone statue in a field just outside
Pavlitsa, a village on the site of the
southeastern precincts of the old city
of Phigalia, some 2.5 miles from the
temple of Apollo Epikourios at Bassai.
He thought that this statue
agreed completely with Pausanias’
description of Arrhachion’s, even to
the half-effaced inscription which he
transcribed from its breast just below
the neck.<a id="FNanchor_2216"></a><a href="#Footnote_2216" class="fnanchor">2216</a> Through the courtesy of
Dr. Svoronos, of the National Numismatic
Museum in Athens, I have been
able to procure a photograph of the
monument from K. Kouroniotis,
the Arkadian <i>Ephor</i> of antiquities stationed
at Bassai, and I present it herewith
(Fig. <a href="#f79">79</a>). The statue is now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">328</a></span>
cared for in the house of the temple guards. This statue, like all
other examples of the series, represents a nude youth standing in a stiff,
constrained attitude. It is badly mutilated and its surface is rough
from weathering. Besides having lost its head, arms, and the lower
part of the legs, it has been broken into two parts across the abdomen.
The ends of curls on either side of the neck, extending a few
inches over the breast, show that the head looked straight forward,
thus following the usual law of “frontality,”<a id="FNanchor_2217"></a><a href="#Footnote_2217" class="fnanchor">2217</a> which precluded any
turning of the body; for a median line drawn down through the
middle of the breastbone, the navel, and the αἰδοῖα would divide the
statue into two equal halves. The body shows the quadrangular form
of the earlier examples, the sculptor having worked in flat planes
at right angles to one another, with the corners merely rounded
off. The remains of arms broken off just below the shoulders show
that they must have hung close to the sides. The shoulders are
broad and square, and display none of the sloping lines characteristic
of other examples, as, <i>e. g.</i>, the one from Tenea. From the breast down
the body is slender, the hips being very narrow. The legs show the
usual flatness and the left one is slightly advanced, as is uniformly the
case in every one of the series. They are somewhat more separated
than in many other examples. The αἰδοῖα form a rude pyramidal mass,
not being differentiated as they are, <i>e. g.</i>, in the statues from Naxos and
Orchomenos<a id="FNanchor_2218"></a><a href="#Footnote_2218" class="fnanchor">2218</a> (Fig. <a href="#f10">10</a>). Some attempt at modeling is visible in the
muscles of the breast and lower abdomen. In general, it may be said
that the similarity in attitude of this statue to Egyptian works impresses
us, as it does in all the examples of early Greek sculpture. As
the subject of Oriental, especially Egyptian, influence on early Greek
art has given rise to very diverse views, we shall make a short digression
at this point to discuss this interesting question.</p>

<h3>EGYPTIAN INFLUENCE ON EARLY GREEK SCULPTURE.</h3>

<p>This question has been under discussion in all its bearings ever since
Brunn, in 1853, tried to demonstrate the originality of the Daidalian
ξόανα,<a id="FNanchor_2219"></a><a href="#Footnote_2219" class="fnanchor">2219</a> but, strangely enough, archæologists are not yet agreed as to
its proper settlement. While some emphasize the spontaneous origin
of Greek art, others quite as strongly advocate that the early Greek<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">329</a></span>
sculptor, at least, copied Egyptian models.<a id="FNanchor_2220"></a><a href="#Footnote_2220" class="fnanchor">2220</a> Thus Furtwaengler, who
early assumed a Cretan origin for the “Apollo” type of statues,<a id="FNanchor_2221"></a><a href="#Footnote_2221" class="fnanchor">2221</a> later
became convinced that it developed in Ionia through Greek contact
with the colony of Naukratis in Egypt, which was founded in the
middle of the seventh century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> He concluded that this plastic type
“<i>ist bekanntlich nichts als die Nachahmung des Haupttypus aegyptischer
statuarischer Kunst</i>”.<a id="FNanchor_2222"></a><a href="#Footnote_2222" class="fnanchor">2222</a> Similarly Collignon traces the archaic male
type to Egyptian influence, and assumes that this influence from the
Nile valley was exerted on the Greek artist before the latter half of
the seventh century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_2223"></a><a href="#Footnote_2223" class="fnanchor">2223</a> On the other hand, H. Lechat, in his review
of the evolution of Greek sculpture from its beginning, believes that
the early sculptor owed but little to Egypt or the East.<a id="FNanchor_2224"></a><a href="#Footnote_2224" class="fnanchor">2224</a> Deonna
entirely rejects the assumption of Egyptian influence, believing that
all the so-called characteristics of early Greek statues can be explained
as the result of natural evolution in Greece itself.<a id="FNanchor_2225"></a><a href="#Footnote_2225" class="fnanchor">2225</a> Von Mach also
completely excludes all foreign influence when he says: “In her sculpture
at least, Greece was independent of influence of any one of the
countries that can at all come under consideration in this connection,
Phœnicia, Assyria, and Egypt.”<a id="FNanchor_2226"></a><a href="#Footnote_2226" class="fnanchor">2226</a> But here, as in so many questions
about Greek art, the truth must lie between the two extremes.<a id="FNanchor_2227"></a><a href="#Footnote_2227" class="fnanchor">2227</a> The
economic conditions of early Greece certainly prove that the Greeks
were dependent on outside peoples in many ways, and there is no a
priori reason for denying this dependence in art. We clearly see Egyptian
influence, for example, in the ceiling of the treasury of Orchomenos,<a id="FNanchor_2228"></a><a href="#Footnote_2228" class="fnanchor">2228</a>
and that the Greeks learned many animal decorative forms as well as
a correct observation of nature from Assyrian art is clear, if we study
the best examples of the late period of that art, the reliefs from the
palace of Assurbanipal at Nineveh (Konyonjik), now in the British<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">330</a></span>
Museum. Such decorative designs could be easily transmitted to the
Greeks by the Phœnicians on embroidered fabrics. It seems reasonable,
therefore, to assume that early Greek artists, especially in the
Greek colonies to the east and south of Greece, were acquainted with
earlier models and especially with those of Egypt. The Greeks themselves
of a later date recognized this debt to Egypt. This is shown
by many passages in Pausanias, which mention the similarity existing
between early Greek and Egyptian sculptures,<a id="FNanchor_2229"></a><a href="#Footnote_2229" class="fnanchor">2229</a> and by the curious
tale told by Diodoros about the Samian artist family of Rhoikos, according
to which the latter’s two sons made the two halves of the statue
of the <i>Pythian Apollo</i> for Samos separately, Telekles working in Samos
and Theodoros in Ephesos. When joined together the two parts
fitted exactly, just as if they had been made by one and the same artist.
Diodoros adds that τοῦτο δὲ τὸ γένος τῆς ἐργασίας παρὰ μὲν τοῖς Ἕλλησι
μηδαμῶς ἐπιτηδεύεσθαι, παρὰ δὲ τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις μάλιστα συντελεῖσθαι.<a id="FNanchor_2230"></a><a href="#Footnote_2230" class="fnanchor">2230</a>
Such a story is valuable in that it shows that the later Greeks believed
that they had adopted the conventional Egyptian canon of proportions.
If we compare any of the “Apollo” statues with Egyptian
standing figures of any period of Egyptian art, as Bulle has done, the
resemblances in detail between the two types will be found to be very
striking. Thus from the Old Kingdom (Memphitic), which included
the first eight dynasties of Manetho,<a id="FNanchor_2231"></a><a href="#Footnote_2231" class="fnanchor">2231</a> we may cite the painted limestone
statue of Ra-nefer and the wooden one of Tepemankh in the Museum
of Cairo (Fig. <a href="#f80">80</a>), two men prominent in the fifth dynasty;<a id="FNanchor_2232"></a><a href="#Footnote_2232" class="fnanchor">2232</a> or
the wood statue of Ka-aper, the so-called <i>Sheik-el-Beled</i>, which represents
the apogee of Memphitic art, and that of his “wife,” without legs
or arms, the two statues being found similarly in a grave at Sakkarah
(Memphis), and now being in the same museum.<a id="FNanchor_2233"></a><a href="#Footnote_2233" class="fnanchor">2233</a> From the Middle
Kingdom, including the eleventh to the seventeenth dynasties,<a id="FNanchor_2234"></a><a href="#Footnote_2234" class="fnanchor">2234</a> we may
mention the painted statue found at Dahshur and now in Cairo, which
represents Horfuabra, the co-regent of Amenemhat III, who was one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">331</a></span>
the kings of the twelfth dynasty.<a id="FNanchor_2235"></a><a href="#Footnote_2235" class="fnanchor">2235</a> From the New Empire, including
the eighteenth to the twentieth dynasties,<a id="FNanchor_2236"></a><a href="#Footnote_2236" class="fnanchor">2236</a> we cite the draped wood
statue of the priestess Tui, a gem of Egyptian art, which was found
in a grave near Gurna, and is now in the Louvre;<a id="FNanchor_2237"></a><a href="#Footnote_2237" class="fnanchor">2237</a> and lastly the draped
alabaster statue of Queen Amenerdis (or Amenartas) in Cairo, the wife
of the Aethiopian King Piankhi, who began to absorb Egypt by 721–722
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, just before the twenty-fourth dynasty.<a id="FNanchor_2238"></a><a href="#Footnote_2238" class="fnanchor">2238</a> After the early dynasties,
the Egyptian type of statue was reduced to a fixed and mechanical
canon, which was used over and over again with lifeless monotony. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">332</a></span>
all these statues, whose dates extend over a period of many centuries,
we note the same technical characteristics which are observable in the
Greek “Apollos,” with the exception that the latter are always nude
and lifelike. These characteristics may be summarized thus: long
hair falling down over the shoulders in a mass;<a id="FNanchor_2239"></a><a href="#Footnote_2239" class="fnanchor">2239</a> shoulders broad in comparison
with the hips; arms hanging down stiffly by the sides<a id="FNanchor_2240"></a><a href="#Footnote_2240" class="fnanchor">2240</a> or crooked
at the elbows;<a id="FNanchor_2241"></a><a href="#Footnote_2241" class="fnanchor">2241</a> hands closed, with the thumbs facing forward and
touching the ends of the index fingers; the left leg slightly advanced
and the soles placed flat on the ground; high ears,<a id="FNanchor_2242"></a><a href="#Footnote_2242" class="fnanchor">2242</a> and the upper body
and head turned straight to the front.<a id="FNanchor_2243"></a><a href="#Footnote_2243" class="fnanchor">2243</a> Only minor differences in the
two types appear. Thus the left foot is always further advanced in
the Egyptian than in the Greek statues, so that the former appear to
have less movement and life.<a id="FNanchor_2244"></a><a href="#Footnote_2244" class="fnanchor">2244</a> Since there is no trace of this type in
Mycenæan art it seems impossible not to conclude that in some way,
doubtless through Ionian sources, it was originally borrowed from
Egypt. The imitation of the Egyptian models, however, was never
slavishly done. The Greek artist immediately rendered the type his own
by making it nude,<a id="FNanchor_2245"></a><a href="#Footnote_2245" class="fnanchor">2245</a> and by transmuting the abstract lifeless schema
of the Egyptians into a highly individualized one characterized by life
and vigor.<a id="FNanchor_2246"></a><a href="#Footnote_2246" class="fnanchor">2246</a> This Egyptian influence, it must be remarked, was operative
only in the initial stage of Greek sculpture; it was soon lost, as the
Greek artist came to rely upon himself. F. A. Lange has truly said:
“<i>Die wahre Unabhaengigkeit der hellenischen Kultur ruht in ihrer Vollendung,
nicht in ihren Anfaengen</i>”.<a id="FNanchor_2247"></a><a href="#Footnote_2247" class="fnanchor">2247</a></p>

</div>

<p>After this digression we will return to the statue of Arrhachion. Dr.
Frazer was unable to decipher the inscription upon the breast with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">333</a></span>
certainty, but made out the following letters, the last four of which
are plainly visible in the photograph: ΕΥΝΛΙΑΔ. He believed them
to be archaic and the first instance of an inscription on this class of
statues. He thought that the name was that of a man, which favored
the view that the “Apollo” statues represented mortals rather than
gods. The letters form a combination manifestly not Greek, and so
may have no significance; it is even possible that they were engraved
in modern times.<a id="FNanchor_2248"></a><a href="#Footnote_2248" class="fnanchor">2248</a> In any case we have the statement of Pausanias
that the inscription was illegible in his day.</p>

<p>There seems little doubt, then, that this mutilated and weather-worn
statue is the very one seen and described by Pausanias and referred
by him to the victor Arrhachion.<a id="FNanchor_2249"></a><a href="#Footnote_2249" class="fnanchor">2249</a> It is presented here for two reasons.
In the first place, it is the oldest dated Olympic victor statue in existence.
Only three older ones are recorded, and none of these has survived to our
time. These three are the statues of the Spartan Eutelidas at Olympia,
who won the boys’ wrestling and pentathlon matches in Ol. 38 (&#8239;=&#8239;628
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>);<a id="FNanchor_2250"></a><a href="#Footnote_2250" class="fnanchor">2250</a> of the Athenian Kylon on the Akropolis, who won the double
running-race in Ol. 35 (&#8239;=&#8239;640 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>);<a id="FNanchor_2251"></a><a href="#Footnote_2251" class="fnanchor">2251</a> of the Spartan Hetoimokles at
Sparta, who won five times in wrestling at the beginning of the sixth
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id="FNanchor_2252"></a><a href="#Footnote_2252" class="fnanchor">2252</a> The statue of Oibotas of Dyme, who won the stade-race
in Ol. 6 (&#8239;=&#8239;756 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), was not set up until Ol. 80 (&#8239;=&#8239;460 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>);<a id="FNanchor_2253"></a><a href="#Footnote_2253" class="fnanchor">2253</a>
that of the Spartan Chionis, who won five running-races in Ols. 28–31
(&#8239;=&#8239;668–656 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), was made later by Myron.<a id="FNanchor_2254"></a><a href="#Footnote_2254" class="fnanchor">2254</a> Pausanias’ statement
(VI. 18.7) that the wooden statues of Praxidamas and Rhexibios, who
won in Ols. 59 and 61 respectively (&#8239;=&#8239;544 and 536 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), were the oldest
at Olympia, is of course incorrect. In the second place, the statue of
Arrhachion actually proves what has often been assumed, that some
of the statues classed as “Apollos” are really victor monuments. As
this question has provoked a good deal of discussion in recent years,
I will briefly review the arguments by which the opinion has gradually
gained acceptance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">334</a></span></p>

<h3>EARLY VICTOR STATUES AND THE “APOLLO” TYPE.</h3>

<p>As the earlier examples of the series were discovered under peculiar
circumstances, they gave no clue to their meaning. Thus the “Apollo”
of Naxos was found in the quarries of the island, while that from
Orchomenos (Fig. <a href="#f10">10</a>) was first seen in the convent of Skripou, its exact
provenience being unknown. From the first they were denominated
“Apollos,” chiefly because of their long hair<a id="FNanchor_2255"></a><a href="#Footnote_2255" class="fnanchor">2255</a> and nudity,<a id="FNanchor_2256"></a><a href="#Footnote_2256" class="fnanchor">2256</a> while the existence
of many small bronzes in the same schema dedicated to the god,<a id="FNanchor_2257"></a><a href="#Footnote_2257" class="fnanchor">2257</a>
and cult statues of similar pose appearing on vase- and wall-paintings,<a id="FNanchor_2258"></a><a href="#Footnote_2258" class="fnanchor">2258</a>
helped to make the identification more probable. Certain ancient
texts, describing archaic statues of Apollo in this pose, were also cited
as evidence, and it was pointed out that many of these statues were
actually found in or near sanctuaries of the god. Thus Diodoros, in
his description of the ξόανον of the <i>Pythian Apollo</i> made for the Samians
by Telekles and Theodoros, which we have already mentioned, says:
τὰς μὲν χεῖρας ἔχον παρατεταμένας, τὰ δὲ σκέλη διαβεβηκότα.<a id="FNanchor_2259"></a><a href="#Footnote_2259" class="fnanchor">2259</a> Probably
the gilded image by the Cretan Cheirisophos in the temple of Apollo
at Tegea was of this type.<a id="FNanchor_2260"></a><a href="#Footnote_2260" class="fnanchor">2260</a> The later type of “Apollo,” with the
arms extended at the elbows, was doubtless followed in the statue of
Apollo made for the Delians by Tektaios and Angelion,<a id="FNanchor_2261"></a><a href="#Footnote_2261" class="fnanchor">2261</a> and in the works
ascribed to Dipoinos and Skyllis and their school. It would be easy to
give an extended list of such “Apollo” statues found in sanctuaries.<a id="FNanchor_2262"></a><a href="#Footnote_2262" class="fnanchor">2262</a>
We might instance one from Naukratis, Egypt;<a id="FNanchor_2263"></a><a href="#Footnote_2263" class="fnanchor">2263</a> one from Delos;<a id="FNanchor_2264"></a><a href="#Footnote_2264" class="fnanchor">2264</a> two
from Aktion;<a id="FNanchor_2265"></a><a href="#Footnote_2265" class="fnanchor">2265</a> several from Mount Ptoion in Bœotia;<a id="FNanchor_2266"></a><a href="#Footnote_2266" class="fnanchor">2266</a> a copy of the
head of the <i>Choiseul-Gouffier</i> Apollo (Pl. <a href="#p7A">7A</a>) found in Kyrene.<a id="FNanchor_2267"></a><a href="#Footnote_2267" class="fnanchor">2267</a> Still
others have been found in <i>temenoi</i> of temples, <i>e. g.</i>, two in that of Apollo
at Naukratis,<a id="FNanchor_2268"></a><a href="#Footnote_2268" class="fnanchor">2268</a> and one in that of Aphrodite there.<a id="FNanchor_2269"></a><a href="#Footnote_2269" class="fnanchor">2269</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">335</a></span></p>

<p>However, against this exclusive interpretation doubts have been
raised with ever-increasing precision, until now we can predicate with
certainty what Loeschke long ago assumed, that the more statues of the
series there are found, the less probable will it become that they should
all be ascribed to Apollo.<a id="FNanchor_2270"></a><a href="#Footnote_2270" class="fnanchor">2270</a> Conze and Michaelis first argued on the basis
of Pausanias’ description of Arrhachion’s statue that this type was
employed for victor statues.<a id="FNanchor_2271"></a><a href="#Footnote_2271" class="fnanchor">2271</a> Koerte’s objection to their view on
the ground of the long hair was refuted by Waldstein, who demonstrated
that athletes were not represented with short hair until after
the Persian wars; he pointed out that the archaic grave-figures of the
mortals Dermys and Kitylos discovered at Tanagra, which were sculptured
in a constrained attitude analogous to that of the “Apollos,”
had long hair.<a id="FNanchor_2272"></a><a href="#Footnote_2272" class="fnanchor">2272</a> We now know that the hair of some of the “Apollos”
is short, which shows the irrelevancy of this argument,<a id="FNanchor_2273"></a><a href="#Footnote_2273" class="fnanchor">2273</a> and we
also know that nudity characterizes many archaic statues of mortals.
Nor do we learn much from dedications, for we have examples of
statues of gods dedicated to other gods and even to goddesses.<a id="FNanchor_2274"></a><a href="#Footnote_2274" class="fnanchor">2274</a>
<i>Ex votos</i> were often more concerned with the dedicator than with
the god to whom the statue was dedicated. Doubtless the cult statues
portrayed on vase-paintings are actually those of Apollo, for at this
epoch other gods, such as Hermes and Dionysos, are bearded.<a id="FNanchor_2275"></a><a href="#Footnote_2275" class="fnanchor">2275</a></p>

<p>Moreover, that a more advanced <i>schema</i> for representing the god
Apollo had already become fixed toward the end of the sixth century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, we know from ancient descriptions of the statue of the god made
for the Delians by Tektaios and Angelion, which represented him in the
usual archaic attitude, <i>i. e.</i>, of the statue of Arrhachion, but with the
notable difference that the forearms were outstretched.<a id="FNanchor_2276"></a><a href="#Footnote_2276" class="fnanchor">2276</a> That this was
the recognized type in the early years of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, is at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">336</a></span>tested
by the bronze statue of the god fashioned by the elder Kanachos
of Sikyon for Branchidai, the pose of which is known from several
statuettes and from a long series of Milesian coins.<a id="FNanchor_2277"></a><a href="#Footnote_2277" class="fnanchor">2277</a> For conservative
reasons this favorite pose was kept for cult statues even into the fourth
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, as we learn from representations on coins of the golden
statue of the god set up in the inmost shrine of the temple at Delphi.<a id="FNanchor_2278"></a><a href="#Footnote_2278" class="fnanchor">2278</a>
But that many of the earlier examples of the “Apollo” series do represent
the god, should not be denied. We agree with Homolle that the old
appellation “Apollo,” after having received too much favor, has now
by reaction become censured too severely, and in general should still
be applied to those statues of the series which have been discovered in
or near sanctuaries of the god, and in the absence of any other indication
to the contrary, also to those which stand upon bases inscribed
with dedications to him.<a id="FNanchor_2279"></a><a href="#Footnote_2279" class="fnanchor">2279</a> Such a statue was found on the island of
Thasos at the bottom of the cella of the temple of Apollo at Alki and is
now in Constantinople.<a id="FNanchor_2280"></a><a href="#Footnote_2280" class="fnanchor">2280</a> The colossal statue found on the island of
Delos just south of the temple of Apollo,<a id="FNanchor_2281"></a><a href="#Footnote_2281" class="fnanchor">2281</a> and the huge torso discovered
in Megara<a id="FNanchor_2282"></a><a href="#Footnote_2282" class="fnanchor">2282</a> may be referred to the god, for their size favors an ascription
to a deity rather than to mortals. And many other examples of the type
found in sanctuaries may very well represent Apollo and other gods.<a id="FNanchor_2283"></a><a href="#Footnote_2283" class="fnanchor">2283</a></p>

<p>That several of the series were also funerary in character is abundantly
proved by the fact that they were discovered in the neighborhood
of tombs. Thus the <i>Apollo of Tenea</i> (Pl. <a href="#p8A">8A</a>) decorated a tomb in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">337</a></span>
necropolis of Tenea near Corinth.<a id="FNanchor_2284"></a><a href="#Footnote_2284" class="fnanchor">2284</a> Likewise the example from Thera
(Fig. <a href="#f9">9</a>) was found in a rock-cut niche.<a id="FNanchor_2285"></a><a href="#Footnote_2285" class="fnanchor">2285</a> Another, now in the British
Museum, was found in the <i>dromos</i> of a tomb on the island of Cyprus,<a id="FNanchor_2286"></a><a href="#Footnote_2286" class="fnanchor">2286</a>
while a fourth was unearthed from the necropolis of Megara Hyblaia in
Sicily.<a id="FNanchor_2287"></a><a href="#Footnote_2287" class="fnanchor">2287</a> The one found at Volomandra in Attika in 1900 was also found
in an old cemetery.<a id="FNanchor_2288"></a><a href="#Footnote_2288" class="fnanchor">2288</a> These furnish proof enough of the sepulchral
character of many of these statues. Such funerary monuments may,
of course, have been been set up also in memory of victors.</p>

<p>We are now in a position, on the basis of Pausanias’ description of
Arrhachion’s statue and the actual monument itself, to maintain with
certainty what hitherto has been conjectured only, that although
some of these archaic sculptures represent Apollo and other gods, sepulchral
dedications, and <i>ex votos</i> in general, others were intended to
represent athletes also. Doubtless the other early victor monuments
recorded, such as the wooden statues of Praxidamas and Rhexibios,
and those of Eutelidas, Kylon, and Hetoimokles, already discussed in
Ch. III, conformed with the earlier type, while that of Milo, described
by Philostratos,<a id="FNanchor_2289"></a><a href="#Footnote_2289" class="fnanchor">2289</a> conformed with the later. Certain examples of the
series have already been ascribed to victors. Thus the marble head of
Attic workmanship found in or near Athens and known as the Rayet-Jacobsen
head (Fig. <a href="#f22">22</a>), has been referred to a pancratiast because of its
swollen and deformed ears.<a id="FNanchor_2290"></a><a href="#Footnote_2290" class="fnanchor">2290</a> Certain statuettes of the same pose as the
“Apollos” have been looked upon as copies of athlete statues.<a id="FNanchor_2291"></a><a href="#Footnote_2291" class="fnanchor">2291</a> So the
early doubts<a id="FNanchor_2292"></a><a href="#Footnote_2292" class="fnanchor">2292</a> as to the meaning of these archaic sculptures have been
resolved in many cases. We have added one well-attested example
to show that they sometimes represented victor monuments.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plans A and B.</span></p>

<p>The first part of this final chapter is a special study in the topography
of the Altis at Olympia. It is an attempt to fix, more or less exactly,
the positions of victor statues erected there, so far as these can be determined
from the data furnished by Pausanias, and from the locations
of the inscribed fragmentary bases of the statues which have been recovered
during the excavations at Olympia.</p>

<h3>STATUES MENTIONED BY PAUSANIAS.</h3>

<p>We shall first attempt to give the positions of the statues mentioned
by Pausanias, who is our chief source of information. After describing
the votive offerings (ἀναθήματα) at the end of Book V, he begins
the enumeration of the monuments of “race-horses ... and
athletes and private individuals” at the beginning of Book VI.<a id="FNanchor_2294"></a><a href="#Footnote_2294" class="fnanchor">2294</a> This
description falls into two routes (ἔφοδοι), the first of which is concerned
with the statues of 168 victors,<a id="FNanchor_2295"></a><a href="#Footnote_2295" class="fnanchor">2295</a> and the second with those of 19.<a id="FNanchor_2296"></a><a href="#Footnote_2296" class="fnanchor">2296</a> Both
accounts also include many “honor” monuments erected to private
persons. The first route begins at the Heraion in the northwestern
part of the sacred enclosure, while the second begins—manifestly where
the first ends—at the Leonidaion at its southwestern corner, and
extends to a point near the so-called Great Altar of Zeus near the
centre of the Altis (see Plans A and B).<a id="FNanchor_2297"></a><a href="#Footnote_2297" class="fnanchor">2297</a> Besides these meagre indications
of his two routes furnished by Pausanias himself, we are
fortunate in knowing exactly the position of one statue, that of Telemachos,
the 122d victor mentioned, the base of which still stands <i>in situ</i>
near the South wall of the Altis, a little southeast of the temple of Zeus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">340</a></span>
showing that the route passed before the eastern front of this temple
and thence westward to the Leonidaion. With these data and
with the help of some forty inscribed bases of statues and other monuments
mentioned by Pausanias, many of which were found in or near
their original positions, it is possible to trace yet more definitely his
routes. Several attempts have been made, since the German excavations,
to define topographically the positions of these statues, especially
by Hirschfeld,<a id="FNanchor_2298"></a><a href="#Footnote_2298" class="fnanchor">2298</a> Scherer,<a id="FNanchor_2299"></a><a href="#Footnote_2299" class="fnanchor">2299</a> Flasch,<a id="FNanchor_2300"></a><a href="#Footnote_2300" class="fnanchor">2300</a> Doerpfeld,<a id="FNanchor_2301"></a><a href="#Footnote_2301" class="fnanchor">2301</a> and the present writer.<a id="FNanchor_2302"></a><a href="#Footnote_2302" class="fnanchor">2302</a></p>

<p>The position of several inscribed base-fragments of statues, corresponding
with Pausanias’ order of presentation, should alone be
sufficient to confute the doubts raised by some scholars that these
routes through the Altis were not topographical.<a id="FNanchor_2303"></a><a href="#Footnote_2303" class="fnanchor">2303</a> But in any attempt
to reconstruct them we must constantly be on our guard against
assuming that Pausanias describes a continuous line or row of monuments,
as both Hirschfeld and Scherer have done. Though here and
there this may have been true, still, generally speaking, we must conceive
of these statues as being strewn about the Altis in no other order
than that they stood in groups, and that these groups had only a general
direction; for we shall see that Pausanias sometimes returns to the
same spot without mentioning it and often leaves long spaces unnoticed.
Apart from the indication of such groups in the description itself, as
attested by the use of such words as παρά, ἐφεξῆς, μετά, πλησίον, ἀνάκειται
ἐπί, ἐγγύτατα, ὄπισθεν, μεταξύ, οὐ πόρρω, οὐ πρόσω, κ.τ.λ., I have
already shown in my previous work that it is possible to reconstruct
many other groups, for abundant proof is there given that statues of
nearly contemporaneous victors were often grouped together, as were
those of the same family or state, or those victorious in the same contest,
or those whose statues were made by the same artist.<a id="FNanchor_2304"></a><a href="#Footnote_2304" class="fnanchor">2304</a> So, in general,
we can group only certain statues in belts or “zones” around some building
or monument which is still <i>in situ</i>. Further than this we can seldom
go. W. Gurlitt has thus well expressed the difficulty of following
these routes of Pausanias: “<i>Jede folgende Statue ist nach der vorhergehenden
orientirt zu denken ... Beziehungen auf frueher oder spaeter
erwaehnte Monumente waren ueberfluessig ... wir sind ... auf<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">341</a></span>
wenige Fixpunkte angewiesen und verfallen daher leicht in den Fehler,
die Wegrichtungen in den Plan zu schematisch einzuzeichnen....
Das Hin und Her auf den viel verschlungenen Wegen der Altis koennen
wir nicht mehr controllieren</i>”.<a id="FNanchor_2305"></a><a href="#Footnote_2305" class="fnanchor">2305</a> In his description of the scattered
altars (V, 14.4–15.12), Pausanias had not the same problem to
meet as in that of the victor statues. As there was so little continuity
in describing the altars, which were strewn all over the Altis, he had
to introduce many other monuments to make their locations known;
but in the case of the victor statues there was great continuity, and
consequently such indications would have been superfluous.<a id="FNanchor_2306"></a><a href="#Footnote_2306" class="fnanchor">2306</a> And, in
general, owing to the number and variety of monuments crowded
together in the circumscribed area of the Altis, he was not compelled to
describe Olympia with such definite detail as Athens. That these
victor statues, however, are described in topographical order is not
only attested by the internal evidence of Pausanias’ words,<a id="FNanchor_2307"></a><a href="#Footnote_2307" class="fnanchor">2307</a> but also
by the finding of many of their bases in the order of his presentation.
With this introductory warning, let us take up the routes of Pausanias
in detail.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The First Ephodos of Pausanias.</span></h4>

<p>Pausanias begins his enumeration in the northeastern part of the
Altis: ἐν δεξιᾷ τοῦ ναοῦ τῆς Ἥρας<a id="FNanchor_2308"></a><a href="#Footnote_2308" class="fnanchor">2308</a>—words which have been the subject of
much discussion as to whether they are to be understood of the temple
<i>pro persona</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the southern side,<a id="FNanchor_2309"></a><a href="#Footnote_2309" class="fnanchor">2309</a> or of the viewpoint of one facing it,
<i>i.e.,</i> the space (especially the northern or right hand half) before the eastern
front.<a id="FNanchor_2310"></a><a href="#Footnote_2310" class="fnanchor">2310</a> From the immediate whereabouts of Pausanias we get no
clue; for at the end of Book V (27.11) he says that he is in the middle of
the Altis, and yet in the following paragraph (27.12)—evidently added
as a transition from the account of the altars to that of the victors—he
mentions the trophy of the people of Mende, in Thrace, which he says
he nearly mistook for the statue of the pancratiast Anauchidas (131), and
this, as we shall see, stood near the South wall of the Altis far from the
centre. Doerpfeld’s contention, therefore, that Pausanias approached
the Heraion from this point, and that consequently the words ἐν δεξιᾷ
must refer to its eastern front, is untenable, and we are left dependent
on the meaning of these words as gathered from other passages
in Pausanias’ work. An examination of several such passages seems to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">342</a></span>
be convincing that they are used here of the Heraion <i>pro persona</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2311"></a><a href="#Footnote_2311" class="fnanchor">2311</a>
Furthermore, the finding of the inscribed tablet from the base of the
statue of Troilos (6) and the pedestal of that of Kyniska (7) in the ruins
of the Prytaneion, <i>i. e.</i>, not far from the western end of the Heraion, and
the base of that of Sophios (22) in the bed of the Kladeos still further
west,<a id="FNanchor_2312"></a><a href="#Footnote_2312" class="fnanchor">2312</a> makes it reasonable to conclude that the first statues mentioned
(VI, 1.3–3.7), those of the Spartan group (Kyniska-Lichas, 7–14),
all of the fifth century, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, flanked on either side by statues of the
fourth, mostly of Eleans (Symmachos-Troilos, 1–6, and Timosthenes-Eupolemos,
15–28), originally stood in the order named by Pausanias
along the southern front of the temple.<a id="FNanchor_2313"></a><a href="#Footnote_2313" class="fnanchor">2313</a></p>

<p>Leaving the Heraion, we get no further fixed point until we arrive
opposite the eastern front of the temple of Zeus. For here around the
foundation of the statue of the <i>Eretrian Bull</i>—still <i>in situ</i> 32 meters east
of the northeastern corner of the temple (see Plans A and B)<a id="FNanchor_2314"></a><a href="#Footnote_2314" class="fnanchor">2314</a>—have
been found fragments of the pedestals of the statues of Narykidas (49)
and Hellanikos (65) to the south, of Kallias (50) and Eukles (52),
beneath that of Kallias, to the north, of Euthymos (56) and Charmides
(58) close together to the east.<a id="FNanchor_2315"></a><a href="#Footnote_2315" class="fnanchor">2315</a> So it is clear that the series of
statues from Narykidas to Charmides (49–58, P., VI, 6. 1–7.1) stood
in this neighborhood. Now the statues of the family of Diagoras, the
Rhodian athlete, stood together (59–63), as Pausanias says (VI, 7.1–2);<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">343</a></span>
one of them, that of Eukles (52), seems to have been moved from its
original position later, as we learn from a scholiast on Pindar’s seventh
Olympian ode,<a id="FNanchor_2316"></a><a href="#Footnote_2316" class="fnanchor">2316</a> who, on the authority of the lost works of Aristotle
and Apollas on the Olympic victors,<a id="FNanchor_2317"></a><a href="#Footnote_2317" class="fnanchor">2317</a> enumerates these statues in an
order different from that adopted by Pausanias, showing that a change
in their positions must have taken place some time between the date of
Aristotle and that of the Periegete.<a id="FNanchor_2318"></a><a href="#Footnote_2318" class="fnanchor">2318</a> The statues of Alkainetos and his
son Hellanikos (64–65) must also have stood together. Inasmuch as
the victors from Euthymos to Lykinos (56–68) are, with one exception,
all pugilists or pancratiasts and of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, they must
have been grouped together, with the family groups of Diagoras and
Alkainetos in the centre.<a id="FNanchor_2319"></a><a href="#Footnote_2319" class="fnanchor">2319</a> We may also add the statues of Dromeus
and Pythokles<a id="FNanchor_2320"></a><a href="#Footnote_2320" class="fnanchor">2320</a> (69–70) of nearly the same date, and we can also extend
the group in the other direction; for the same scholiast says that
the statue of Diagoras stood near that of the Spartan Lysandros (35 a).<a id="FNanchor_2321"></a><a href="#Footnote_2321" class="fnanchor">2321</a>
Pausanias (VI, 3.14 and 4.1) says that the statue of Lysandros stood
between those of Pyrilampes and Athenaios (35–36). Thus we can
conclude that the 36 statues (35–70, VI, 3.13–7.10) stood in the zone
of the <i>Eretrian Bull</i>, extending perhaps across the Altis to the vicinity
of the Echo Colonnade along its eastern boundary.</p>

<p>It would follow, then, that the intervening statues from Oibotas to
Xenophon (29–34, P., VI, 3.8–3.13) stood somewhere between the
Heraion and the <i>Eretrian Bull</i>. It is idle to discuss the route between
these two monuments more definitely.<a id="FNanchor_2322"></a><a href="#Footnote_2322" class="fnanchor">2322</a></p>

<p>Our next fixed point is the <i>Victory</i> of Paionios, whose foundation is
still standing in its original position, 37 meters due east of the southeast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">344</a></span>
corner of the temple of Zeus.<a id="FNanchor_2323"></a><a href="#Footnote_2323" class="fnanchor">2323</a> For, of the next few statues mentioned,
the base of that of Sosikrates (71) was found “somewhere” east of the
temple, that of Kritodamos (80) before the “Southeast Building,”
and that of Xenokles (85), 4 meters to the northeast of the <i>Victory</i> base,
presumably near its original position.<a id="FNanchor_2324"></a><a href="#Footnote_2324" class="fnanchor">2324</a> Pausanias groups the three
Arkadian athletes, Euthymenes-Kritodamos (78–80, P., VI, 8.5); then,
after naming four statues of victors from other states, he mentions two
more Arkadians together, Xenokles and Alketos (85–86, VI, 9.2); and
he continues by saying that the statues of the Argives Aristeus and
Cheimon (87–88, VI, 9.3) stood together. One more statue, that of
Phillen or Philys<a id="FNanchor_2325"></a><a href="#Footnote_2325" class="fnanchor">2325</a> of Elis (89), is named before he comes to the chariot
of Gelo. Thus we may conclude that the series of statues denoted by
the numbers 71–89 (P., VI, 8.1–9.4) stood to the south of the <i>Eretrian
Bull</i> in the parallel zone of the <i>Victory</i>.</p>

<p>We next come to the series of statues mentioned between the chariots
of Gelo and Kleosthenes (90–99). The position of the bases of these
chariots is practically certain. In describing the statues of Zeus in Book
V, Pausanias says he is proceeding north from the Council-house (23.1),
and first mentions a statue of Zeus set up by the Greeks who fought
at Platæa; in describing the victor statues he says that the chariot
of Kleosthenes stands behind this statue of Zeus (P., VI, 10.6). After
describing the <i>Zeus</i> of Platæa, he mentions a bronze inscribed tablet as
standing in front of it (V, 23.4), which recorded the thirty years’ treaty
of peace between Sparta and Athens, and then says that the statue of the
<i>Zeus</i> of the Megarians stands near the chariot of Kleosthenes (23.5).
As he is proceeding north, this Megarian <i>Zeus</i> must have stood north
of the Platæan one; thus in one group we have the two statues of Zeus
and the chariot of Kleosthenes. Immediately to the north he next
mentions the chariot of the Syracusan tyrant Gelo (90), which he says
is near the statue of the <i>Zeus</i> of the Hyblæans (23.6). Now in coming
south, in the athlete <i>periegesis</i>, he names eight statues between these
chariots. Doerpfeld<a id="FNanchor_2326"></a><a href="#Footnote_2326" class="fnanchor">2326</a> has identified the base of the Platæan <i>Zeus</i> with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">345</a></span>
large pedestal to the northwest of that of the victor Telemachos (122)
found <i>in situ</i> near the South Altis wall,<a id="FNanchor_2327"></a><a href="#Footnote_2327" class="fnanchor">2327</a> a position which is in harmony
with the description of the statues of Zeus; just behind it he has identified
two large foundations near together as those of the two chariots.
So the eight intervening statues stood here. Of the statues between
the chariot of Kleosthenes and the base of the statue of Telemachos,
the base of that of Tellon (102) was found in the East Byzantine wall
near the South Altis wall; that of Aristion (115) nearby, embedded in
the same wall; that of Akestorides (119), whose name I have inserted in
the lacuna in the text of Pausanias (VI, 13.7),<a id="FNanchor_2328"></a><a href="#Footnote_2328" class="fnanchor">2328</a> just northeast of the
base of Telemachos.<a id="FNanchor_2329"></a><a href="#Footnote_2329" class="fnanchor">2329</a> Thus the series of statues from that of Gelo to
that of Agathinos (90–121a, P., VI, 9.4–13.11) can be grouped in the
zone of the <i>Chariots</i>.</p>

<p>As the fragment of the base of the statue of the Athenian pancratiast
Aristophon (123) was found near the base of Telemachos, but to the
east of it, and likewise that which supported the equestrian monument
of Xenombrotos and Xenodikos (133–134) still further to the east near
the Echo Colonnade,<a id="FNanchor_2330"></a><a href="#Footnote_2330" class="fnanchor">2330</a> we can conclude that the twenty-one statues from
Aristophon to Prokles (123–138, P., VI, 13.11–14.13), mostly of the
fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, stood near the South Altis wall to the east (and not
to the west of the base of Telemachos, where all other investigators
have wrongly placed them),<a id="FNanchor_2331"></a><a href="#Footnote_2331" class="fnanchor">2331</a> and thus form a group which we can call
the zone of <i>Telemachos</i>. So we conclude that the long list of statues<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">346</a></span>
from Pyrilampes to Prokles (35–138), nearly two-thirds of all those mentioned
in the first ἔφοδος of Pausanias, stood in the space to the east and
southeast of the temple of Zeus, grouped in the parallel zones of the
<i>Bull</i>, <i>Victory</i>, <i>Chariots</i>, and <i>Telemachos</i>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the statues beginning with the two of Aischines
(139) and extending to that of Philonides (154 a) (P., VI, 14.13–16.5)
must have stood to the west of the base of Telemachos and along the
South Terrace wall some 20 meters south of the temple of Zeus, where
many of the following pedestals were found in the order named by Pausanias:
that of Aischines (139) was found in the Council-house; that
of Archippos (140) nearby between the South Terrace wall and the
north wing of the Council-house; that of Epitherses (147) opposite the
sixth column of the temple from the west, some eleven paces from the
South Terrace wall, and the fragment of the base of the honor statue
of Antigonos (147 f) very near it; the bronze foot of one of the statues
of Kapros (150) was found in the South Terrace wall, 24.40 meters
from the southwest corner of the temple; and lastly, the base of the
“honor” statue of Philonides (154 a), Alexander’s courier, was found in
the southwest corner of the Altis at the extreme west end of the South
Terrace wall, almost, if not exactly, in its original position.<a id="FNanchor_2332"></a><a href="#Footnote_2332" class="fnanchor">2332</a> Thus
Pausanias, after coming south to the statue of Telemachos, first goes
eastward as far as the statue of Prokles, then returns, repassing the
two chariots on the way without remark, and then continues westward
to the southwestern corner of the Altis. All statues west of that of Telemachos
are of the fifth and fourth centuries <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, with the exception of
one, that of Eutelidas (148), who won in Ol. 38. This is the oldest
statue in the Altis, despite Pausanias’ statement,<a id="FNanchor_2333"></a><a href="#Footnote_2333" class="fnanchor">2333</a> and it doubtless
originally stood in the area occupied later toward the middle of the
fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> by the temple of Zeus, but was then transferred to its
new position south of the temple.</p>

<p>After the statue of Philonides, there are still 19 statues of victors
and “honor” men to dispose of in this first ἔφοδος, those from Brimias
to Glaukon (155–169, P., VI, 16.5–16.9). Of these statues,
the base of that of Leonidas of Naxos (155a), the founder of the great
building just outside the southwestern corner of the Altis named after
him, was discovered in a Byzantine wall before the eastern end of the
north front of that building, while that of Seleadas (159) was unearthed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">347</a></span>
within the ruins of the same building; the base which supported the
group-monument of Polypeithes and Kalliteles (160–161)—which,
owing to the early dates of their victories, some time between
Ols. (?) 66 and 70 (&#8239;=&#8239;516 and 500 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), must have stood originally
in the area later occupied by the temple of Zeus, like that of the
above-mentioned Eutelidas—a little to the south of the Byzantine
church, between the bases of the statues of Leonidas and Glaukon;
two fragments of the base of the statue of Deinosthenes (163) have
been found, one east of the apse of the church, the other in the
ruins of the Palaistra further north; and lastly, that of Glaukon,
built into late walls northwest of the church.<a id="FNanchor_2334"></a><a href="#Footnote_2334" class="fnanchor">2334</a> As the statue of Philonides
stood at the extreme western end of the South Altis wall, and
as most of these fragments were found in the vicinity of the Leonidaion,
it would be natural to conclude that the majority of these
later statues stood in the spaces just outside the West Altis wall.
But at the end of the first ἔφοδος (VI, 17.1) Pausanias says that he has
so far named statues “within the Altis”; hence most investigators
have placed these 19 statues either west of the temple of Zeus or in
the space at the southwestern corner of the Altis. A little further on
we shall see that many other victor statues, not mentioned by Pausanias,
stood just outside the West Altis wall, and it is doubtful whether
his words ἐν τῇ Ἄλτει (VI, 17.1) should be taken thus literally,
especially on any theory of his use of earlier accounts in the final compiling
of his own. If they were “within” the Altis, they could scarcely
have stood to the west or southwest of the temple of Zeus, for the
second ἔφοδος, as we shall see, passed there.</p>

<p>A better alternative can be found. In describing the Leonidaion
(V, 15.2), Pausanias says that this building stood “outside the sacred
enclosure at the processional entrance into the Altis ... separated
from this entrance by a street; for what the Athenians call lanes, the
Eleans name streets.”<a id="FNanchor_2335"></a><a href="#Footnote_2335" class="fnanchor">2335</a> Now Doerpfeld has shown that inside the
West Altis wall and parallel to it—just south of the base of Philonides’
statue—is a line of bases ending in the later South wall of the
Altis, so that this West wall and row of pedestals form a <i>cul de sac</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">348</a></span>
(see Plan B).<a id="FNanchor_2336"></a><a href="#Footnote_2336" class="fnanchor">2336</a> It is clear that no such row of statues would have
been placed leading up to a dead wall; therefore these statues must
have stood there before the wall was built, and must once have
formed the eastern boundary of a broad street skirting the eastern
side of the Leonidaion, which was twice as wide as later, when the
wall cut off half its breadth and made it a “lane,” though the older name
“street” was retained. The later Roman enlargement of the Altis
is well known. The long row of pedestals to the south of and parallel
to those already discussed as standing along the line of the South
Terrace wall, westward of the base of Telemachos, once constituted
the southern boundary of the “Processional Way” (ὁδὸς πομπική),
which ran from the Leonidaion to where it debouched into the Altis
at its southeastern corner. Originally outside the Altis, they were
later, together with the road itself, included in it. The pedestals,
then, in the above-mentioned <i>cul de sac</i>, and also the fourteen (among
them that of Metellus Macedonicus; see Plan B) that adorned the
south side of the Processional Way, may be the remains of some of
these last statues mentioned by Pausanias.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Second Ephodos of Pausanias.</span></h4>

<p>We next come to the second ἔφοδος, which is introduced by these
words: Εἰ δὲ ἀπὸ τοῦ Λεωνιδαίου πρὸς τὸν βωμὸν τὸν μέγαν ἀφικέσθαι τῇ
δεξιᾷ θελήσειας, τοσάδε ἔστι σοὶ τῶν ἀνηκόντων ἐς μνήμην.<a id="FNanchor_2337"></a><a href="#Footnote_2337" class="fnanchor">2337</a> The Leonidaion,
the site of which was still in dispute till after the close of the
excavations, was finally identified by Treu<a id="FNanchor_2338"></a><a href="#Footnote_2338" class="fnanchor">2338</a> with the so-called <i>Suedwestbau</i>,
as had been already assumed by many investigators.<a id="FNanchor_2339"></a><a href="#Footnote_2339" class="fnanchor">2339</a> The
site of the Great Altar, however, is still undetermined. The elliptical
depression to the east of the Pelopion, whose dimensions (125 feet in
circumference) agree with the figures of Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_2340"></a><a href="#Footnote_2340" class="fnanchor">2340</a> for the <i>prothysis</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">349</a></span>
or lowest stage of the altar, identified with it by most scholars,<a id="FNanchor_2341"></a><a href="#Footnote_2341" class="fnanchor">2341</a> must
now be given up since the more recent excavations of Doerpfeld, which
prove it to be the remains of two prehistoric dwelling houses with apse-like
ends.<a id="FNanchor_2342"></a><a href="#Footnote_2342" class="fnanchor">2342</a> Nor can the remains of walls lying between the Heraion and
the Pelopion, formerly supposed to be those of an altar, any longer be
referred to the Great Altar (as Puchstein and Wernicke referred them)<a id="FNanchor_2343"></a><a href="#Footnote_2343" class="fnanchor">2343</a>
since Doerpfeld’s recent discoveries. So we are dependent on the words
of Pausanias alone for its location, who says that it stood “equidistant
from the Pelopion and the sanctuary of Hera, but in front of both,”<a id="FNanchor_2344"></a><a href="#Footnote_2344" class="fnanchor">2344</a>
therefore somewhat northwest of the elliptical depression nearer the
centre of the Altis.<a id="FNanchor_2345"></a><a href="#Footnote_2345" class="fnanchor">2345</a> Our problem, then, is to find Pausanias’ route
between these two points, and here again, as at the beginning of the
first ἔφοδος, we must rightly interpret the words ἐν δεξιᾷ. Michaelis,
in his article on the use of ἐν δεξιᾷ and ἐν ἀριστερᾷ in Pausanias’ work,
made these words refer to the southern side of the Processional Way,
<i>i. e.</i>, to the side at the right of Pausanias, who was facing east after
arriving at the Leonidaion.<a id="FNanchor_2346"></a><a href="#Footnote_2346" class="fnanchor">2346</a> Thus the statues already mentioned
along the South Terrace wall (Aischines to Philonides, 139–154a)
would now be on his left side. On this interpretation both Hirschfeld
and Doerpfeld had the second ἔφοδος follow the Processional Way eastward
parallel to the first—thus including the line of pedestals, which
we have referred to the end of the first—and then, near the Council<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">350</a></span>house,
curve northward in front of the temple of Zeus, which virtually
would be a repetition of the first ἔφοδος. On this theory Doerpfeld<a id="FNanchor_2347"></a><a href="#Footnote_2347" class="fnanchor">2347</a>
wrongly explained the first route as containing statues ἐν τῇ Ἄλτει,
while the second was outside the older Altis, and so, though equally
long, contained fewer statues. But against this interpretation it must
be urged that the Periegete is describing the Altis of his day, when the
road in question was included within its boundaries, and that the Great
Altar and the two last statues mentioned (187, 188) as standing near
the pillar of Oinomaos were always inside.<a id="FNanchor_2348"></a><a href="#Footnote_2348" class="fnanchor">2348</a> And neither this Processional
Way nor the space before the eastern front of the temple of Zeus
were localities for “unimportant mixed statues.”<a id="FNanchor_2349"></a><a href="#Footnote_2349" class="fnanchor">2349</a> Furthermore, if
he had merely retraced his steps after arriving at the Leonidaion—and
he says nothing of returning—he would not have begun a new route<a id="FNanchor_2350"></a><a href="#Footnote_2350" class="fnanchor">2350</a>,
but would have said something like this: Εί δὲ ὀπίσω ἀναστρέψας ἀπὸ
τοῦ Λεωνιδαίου πρὸς τὸν βωμὸν αὐθις ἀφικέσθαι τῇ δεξιᾷ θελήσειας.<a id="FNanchor_2351"></a><a href="#Footnote_2351" class="fnanchor">2351</a>  So it
is simpler to conclude that the new route wound around the western
and northern sides of the temple of Zeus over the temple terrace.<a id="FNanchor_2352"></a><a href="#Footnote_2352" class="fnanchor">2352</a> As
no building is mentioned on the way, and as the north side of the temple
would probably have been called ἀριστερὰ πλευρά (in accordance
with the usage discussed above in connection with the Heraion), and
as the Pelopion faces southwest, the words ἐν δεξιᾷ can refer only to the
right hand of Pausanias, <i>i. e.</i>, the right side of the road followed. If
we assume that these words originally stood after τοσάδε ἔστι σοί and
were transferred by a later copyist, the difficulty is resolved.<a id="FNanchor_2353"></a><a href="#Footnote_2353" class="fnanchor">2353</a></p>

<p>Of the nineteen victor statues in this second route (170–188, VI, 17.1–18.7)
no bases have been found.<a id="FNanchor_2354"></a><a href="#Footnote_2354" class="fnanchor">2354</a> But of the three “honor” statues<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">351</a></span>
included, one base, that of the rhetorician Gorgias of Leontini (184a),
was recovered 10 meters northeast of the temple of Zeus, and so probably
not very far from its original position;<a id="FNanchor_2355"></a><a href="#Footnote_2355" class="fnanchor">2355</a> for Pausanias mentions
only three more statues, before he comes to the last two in this ἔφοδος,
which two stood in this vicinity. The parts of the Altis to the west
and north of the temple were unimportant till the time of Alexander
the Great, and were, therefore, remarkably free of monuments. In the
whole description of Pausanias, we know of only three altars (those of
Aphrodite, the Seasons, and the Nymphs) and a wild olive tree (the
“Olive of the Beautiful Crown”) to the west of the temple (V, 15.3),
and only of the votive offerings of a certain Mikythos or Smikythos
to the north of it (V, 26.2).<a id="FNanchor_2356"></a><a href="#Footnote_2356" class="fnanchor">2356</a> As the statue of Gorgias stood among
the “unimportant mixed statues” already mentioned (184–186), these
must have stood somewhere north of the temple near its eastern end.
Finally, the two ancient wooden statues of Praxidamas and Rhexibios
(187–188, P., VI, 18.7) are mentioned by themselves as near the column
of Oinomaos, which Pausanias elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_2357"></a><a href="#Footnote_2357" class="fnanchor">2357</a> says stood near the Great
Altar of Zeus to the left of a road running south from it to the temple.
Pausanias, after describing these “mixed” statues, may have finally
left the route thus far followed and introduced these last two statues as
quite distinct from the second ἔφοδος.<a id="FNanchor_2358"></a><a href="#Footnote_2358" class="fnanchor">2358</a> But he does not seem to have
gone far from his route, for immediately after ending his account of the
victor statues, he begins his account of the Treasuries, which lay
beyond the Great Altar farther north.<a id="FNanchor_2359"></a><a href="#Footnote_2359" class="fnanchor">2359</a> (Plans A and B.)</p>

<p>Thus Pausanias ends his second route somewhere short of the Great
Altar, and it appears after all to be only a continuation of the first,
forming with it one unbroken “<i>Rundgang</i>,” though in quite a different
sense of the word from that intended by Doerpfeld.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">352</a></span></p>

<h3>SUMMARY OF RESULTS.</h3>

<p>From a study of these two routes, and a comparison of the dates
of the victorious athletes,<a id="FNanchor_2360"></a><a href="#Footnote_2360" class="fnanchor">2360</a> we can draw the following conclusions as to
the positions of the victor statues mentioned by Pausanias as standing
in the Altis at Olympia:</p>

<p>1. The twenty-eight oldest statues—exclusive of the five already
mentioned as having been removed from the area of the later temple
of Zeus<a id="FNanchor_2361"></a><a href="#Footnote_2361" class="fnanchor">2361</a>—dating from Ol. 58 (&#8239;=&#8239;548 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, Pythokritos, 128 b) to Ol.
76 (&#8239;=&#8239;476 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, Theognetos, 83), <i>i. e.</i>, approximately down to the date
of the founding of the temple,<a id="FNanchor_2362"></a><a href="#Footnote_2362" class="fnanchor">2362</a> stood in the space between the eastern
front of the temple and the Echo Colonnade, or to the south of it near
the South Altis wall. Only one statue (that of Protolaos, 48) stood as
far north as the <i>Eretrian Bull</i>. Thus the southeastern part of the Altis
was the oldest part dedicated to victor statues.</p>

<p>2. After this space was mostly filled, the next statues, those dating
from Ol. 77 (&#8239;=&#8239;472 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, Kallias, 50) to Ol. 93 (&#8239;=&#8239;408 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, Eubotas, 75),
<i>i. e.</i>, from about the time of the foundation of the temple to near the
date of the battle of Aigospotamoi, fifty-one in number, stood between
the Heraion and the <i>Victory</i> of Paionios; only one stood as far south
as the Altis wall, while seven stood around the <i>Chariots</i>, ten around
the <i>Victory</i>, twenty around the <i>Bull</i>, and the rest further north (including
176, 185 of the second ἔφοδος, which stood north of the eastern
end of the temple). Diagoras and his family (59–63), boxers and
pancratiasts, had their statues near the older famous boxer Euthymos
(56); Alkainetos and his sons (64–66), boxers, besides many other
pugilists, had theirs near the Diagorids; Tellon (102) had his near that
of his compatriot Epikradios (101); later Achæans had theirs near
that of their countryman Oibotas (29), and Spartans near that of Chionis
(111); some, as the three victors from Heraia (176, 177, 32),<a id="FNanchor_2363"></a><a href="#Footnote_2363" class="fnanchor">2363</a> stood
far apart only apparently, for the last one had his statue near the <i>Bull</i>,
and so not far from the other two, though these are named in the second
ἔφοδος.</p>

<p>3. From near the date of the battle of Aigospotamoi, down to about
the birth of Alexander the Great, <i>i. e.</i>, from Ol. 94 to Ol. 106 (&#8239;=&#8239;404 to
356 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), thirty-six statues filled in the intervals left among these
older statues; fifteen stood near the Heraion; five between it and the
<i>Bull</i>, seven around the <i>Bull</i>, five around the <i>Victory</i>, one near the <i>Chariots</i>,
and three along the South Altis wall. Euthymenes and Kritodamos
(78, 80) had their monuments near that of their older countryman (79),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">353</a></span>
whose statue was made by Myron; the Ephesians, Pyrilampes and Athenaios
(35, 36), had their statues beside that of their benefactor Lysandros
(35 a).</p>

<p>4. After Alexander’s time, in consequence of the recent building of
the Philippeion, Leonidaion, and Theekoleon to the west of the Altis,
the western side of the temple of Zeus (and, to a lesser extent, the
northern) became important, and henceforth statues surrounded the
temple on all sides. Of the thirty-three statues of this epoch, nine stood
to the west of the temple, four to the north, and seven to the south,
while the rest stood either to the east, or, perhaps, near the Heraion.
We shall see also that many later statues, known to us from inscriptions
only, stood outside the Altis, to the west and northwest.</p>

<h3>STATUES NOT MENTIONED BY PAUSANIAS, BUT KNOWN
FROM RECOVERED BASES.</h3>

<p>Having established these data, it is not difficult, from the positions
of the many inscribed fragmentary bases found at Olympia and referred
to victor statues not mentioned by Pausanias, from the approximate
dates of the victories as gained from the age of the inscriptions,
and by again employing the system of groups already mentioned, to
state quite definitely where many of these other statues stood. Pausanias,
who mentions 187 victors with 192 monuments in his two
ἔφοδοι, expressly states that he enumerates only those “who had some
title to fame or whose statues were better made.”<a id="FNanchor_2364"></a><a href="#Footnote_2364" class="fnanchor">2364</a> The reasons for
his selection and the fact that he mentions the statue of no athlete
certainly later than the middle of the second century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> (although we
know from inscriptions that statues were set up far into the third century
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span>, at least)<a id="FNanchor_2365"></a><a href="#Footnote_2365" class="fnanchor">2365</a> have been subjects of much discussion, but hardly
concern us here.<a id="FNanchor_2366"></a><a href="#Footnote_2366" class="fnanchor">2366</a> The three latest statues of victors mentioned by
Pausanias, whose dates are fixed, may be given: those of Kleitomachos,
who won παγκράτιον and πύξ in Ols. 141 and 142 (&#8239;=&#8239;216 and 212 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>);<a id="FNanchor_2367"></a><a href="#Footnote_2367" class="fnanchor">2367</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">354</a></span>
of Kapros, victor in παγκράτιον and πάλη in Ol. 142 (&#8239;=&#8239;212 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>);<a id="FNanchor_2368"></a><a href="#Footnote_2368" class="fnanchor">2368</a> and
of Akestorides, victor πώλων ἅρματι sometime between Ols. 142 and 144
(&#8239;=&#8239;212 and 204 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_2369"></a><a href="#Footnote_2369" class="fnanchor">2369</a> Still later statues of victors named by Pausanias,
whose dates can not be exactly determined, are those of
Sodamas, who won παίδων στάδιον some time between Ols. 142 and
145 (&#8239;=&#8239;212 and 200 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>);<a id="FNanchor_2370"></a><a href="#Footnote_2370" class="fnanchor">2370</a> of Amyntas, victor in παίδων παγκράτιον in

the South Altis wall, and the statue must originally have stood east of

two fragments of whose base were found, one near the Heraion and the

statues of the only other pancratiasts of a similar age, either near those of
Dorieus (61), who won in Ols. 87 to 89 (&#8239;=&#8239;432 to 424 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), and Damagetos
(62), who won in Ols. 82 and 83 (&#8239;=&#8239;452 and 448 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), in the zone of the
<i>Bull</i>, or near that of Timasitheos (82), who won some time between Ols.
(?) 65 and 67 inclusive (&#8239;=&#8239;520 and 512 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), in the zone of the <i>Victory</i>.
Lastly, the second inscribed base of Xenombrotos (133), found near the
Council-house outside the South Altis wall, doubtless once stood near
the first (the epigram from which is preserved by Pausanias, VI, 14.12),
along this wall to the east of the base of Telemachos.<a id="FNanchor_2385"></a><a href="#Footnote_2385" class="fnanchor">2385</a></p>

<p>No inscribed fragments of bases dating from the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>
have been found.</p>

<p>Beginning with the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, we shall see that most of the
recovered bases were found either in the western part of the Altis, in the
neighborhood of the Philippeion, Theekoleon, and Leonidaion, on both
sides of the West Altis wall, or still farther west and northwest, especially
in or near the Palaistra and Prytaneion. We have already seen
that most of the statues named by Pausanias dating from Alexander’s
time stood to the west (and north) of the temple of Zeus. As Pausanias
enumerates only statues ἐν δεξιᾷ of his route around the temple to the
Great Altar, these statues farther west and northwest are omitted
from his account. Of the four bases of statues referred to the third
century, all belong to Elean victors; three were found west and northwest
of the Prytaneion and beyond, showing that these statues once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">356</a></span>
stood in the vicinity of this building, and the fourth was found farther
south, by the Palaistra, where it probably stood. Thus the base of
the wrestler Nikarchos, son of Physsias, was found in a late wall west
of the Prytaneion;<a id="FNanchor_2386"></a><a href="#Footnote_2386" class="fnanchor">2386</a> that of the statue of an unknown victor, son of
Taurinos, was found at the southeast corner of the Palaistra;<a id="FNanchor_2387"></a><a href="#Footnote_2387" class="fnanchor">2387</a> that of
another unknown victor, the son of ... phinos, was found in the
<i>Nordwestgraben</i>;<a id="FNanchor_2388"></a><a href="#Footnote_2388" class="fnanchor">2388</a> the base of the statue of Thersonides, son of
Paianodoros, victor κέλητι πωλικῷ, was found northwest of the Prytaneion,
between the Roman baths and east hall of the Gymnasion.<a id="FNanchor_2389"></a><a href="#Footnote_2389" class="fnanchor">2389</a></p>

<p>Of the four statues referred with certainty to the second century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>,
all but one were found to the west of the Altis, in a region ranging from
the Philippeion, northwest of the temple of Zeus, to the Leonidaion
southwest of it. Two of them were found outside the West Altis wall,
between the Leonidaion and the Byzantine church. Thus the base of
the statue of D ... gonos, twice victor in πύξ, was found outside
the apse of the Byzantine church and west of the West Altis wall;<a id="FNanchor_2390"></a><a href="#Footnote_2390" class="fnanchor">2390</a>
the fragments of that of an unknown boy victor in wrestling or the
pankration were found in the East Byzantine wall;<a id="FNanchor_2391"></a><a href="#Footnote_2391" class="fnanchor">2391</a> that of an unknown

another unknown victor in wrestling, the son of the Elean Aigyptos,
was found to the northeast of the Leonidaion.<a id="FNanchor_2393"></a><a href="#Footnote_2393" class="fnanchor">2393</a></p>

<p>Of the seven bases referred to the second and first centuries <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>,
three were found in or near the Byzantine church, showing that such
statues may have stood in the Greek building which was later converted
into the church.<a id="FNanchor_2394"></a><a href="#Footnote_2394" class="fnanchor">2394</a> Two more were found near the southwest corner of
the Altis, and therefore may once have stood near the statue of Philonides,
which Pausanias mentions as standing in that vicinity. Two
others stood farther away, one inside the Prytaneion, the other northeast
of the temple of Zeus. Thus the base of an unknown victor, the
son of Aristotle, συνωρίδι πωλικῇ, was found in front of the north side
of the Byzantine church;<a id="FNanchor_2395"></a><a href="#Footnote_2395" class="fnanchor">2395</a> that of Aristodamos, the son of Aleximachos

<p>The positions of the twenty-four bases (belonging to monuments
of twenty-two victors) with certainty referred to the first pre-Christian
century were very scattered. One large Pentelic marble
<i>bathron</i>, supporting the monuments of seven victors of the family of
Philistos, must have stood just south of the Philippeion, where most of
the fragments were found. The bases of the statues of two other sons
and a grandson of the same victor have been recovered, and doubtless
stood near by, thus forming a family group of ten, outnumbering that
of Diagoras (59–63 and 52) mentioned by Pausanias. The omission
of so important a monument in the description of the Periegete has,
of course, been used as an indication of his employment of earlier lists.
Of the other bases, two were found outside the South Altis wall, west
of the Council-house, and two east of it; two east of the temple of Zeus
(one of them that of the youthful Tiberius, afterwards Roman emperor,
which must have stood near the <i>Eretrian Bull</i>, where it was found);
one southwest of the temple, along the South Terrace wall, pointing
to a position among the statues there named by Pausanias; one east of
the Byzantine church, pointing to a position south of the Theekoleon,
two to the northwest of the Altis in the vicinity of the Prytaneion; while
the others were found scattered all the way from the northeastern part of
the Altis to the bed of the Kladeos. Thus over half (13) of these statue-bases
were found in the west and northwest of the Altis and beyond;
the space to the east of the temple of Zeus—called <i>frequentissimus
celeberrimusque</i> by Scherer—seems now not to have been greatly prized.
Most of these victories were gained in hippic contests. Horse-racing
had early been discontinued, but was revived at the end of the first
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, when members of the imperial family, emulating the
earlier triumphs of the princes of Sicily and Macedonia, became competitors.
Thus Tiberius won in the chariot-race, and a few years later
his nephew Germanicus in the same event. The list of these bases of
victor statues of the first century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> and their provenience follows. A
fragment of the base of the victor Agilochos, son of Nikeas of Elis, victor

<p>Nineteen inscribed base-fragments have been referred to the post-Christian
centuries, thirteen to the first, three to the second, and three
to the third. The spaces around the temple of Zeus (especially its
eastern front) are again the favorite ones. Thus the bases of three
statues were found east of the temple (one <i>in situ</i>), two near its southeastern
corner, three at the northeastern corner (one, that of Germanicus
Cæsar, the nephew of Tiberius, just to the north of the <i>Eretrian
Bull</i>, and so originally standing here near that of his uncle), while
another stood opposite the fifth column from the east on the north
side of the temple. Most of these statues must have been passed by
Pausanias in his first ἔφοδος, which is, perhaps, another evidence of
his dependence on older lists in compiling his own. Two other bases
were found to the southwest of the temple, one of them near its cor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">359</a></span>ner,
and the other nearer the corner of the Altis, <i>i. e.</i>, near the base of
the statue of Philonides (154a). Thus eleven statues stood near the
temple. Of the others, four were found in the vicinity of the Palaistra
(one inside <i>in situ</i>), one to the northeast of the Prytaneion, another
northeast of the Byzantine church, while the two remaining ones were
found in the eastern part of the Altis, near the entrance to the Stadion
and before the Echo Colonnade respectively. The base of the last
statue of a victor known to have been erected at Olympia, that of
Valerios Eklektos of Sinope, previously mentioned, was found <i>in situ</i>
in the Palaistra. We append a detailed list of these bases, giving the
provenience of each.</p>

<p>Of the first century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span>, the fore part of the base of the monument

<p>Of the second century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span>, we have the following bases: that of

<p>Of the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span>, <i>i. e.</i>, after the time of Pausanias, we have
these bases: that of P. Ailios Alkandridas, son of Damokratidas of

church;<a id="FNanchor_2434"></a><a href="#Footnote_2434" class="fnanchor">2434</a> that of Theopropos of Rhodes, who won κέλητι, was unearthed

was found <i>in situ</i> in the Palaistra.<a id="FNanchor_2436"></a><a href="#Footnote_2436" class="fnanchor">2436</a> We should add for this century
also the inscribed bronze diskos, the votive (not victor) offering of

south of the Southwest gate of the Altis.<a id="FNanchor_2437"></a><a href="#Footnote_2437" class="fnanchor">2437</a></p>

<p>A study of these inscriptions shows that the practice of setting up
victor statues decreased in the fourth and third centuries <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, but was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">361</a></span>
revived in the second and first, only to decrease again after the first
century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span> On the other hand, the inscriptions show that the number
of “honor” statues correspondingly increased. Of the later statues,
most were erected to Eleans; names of victors from Sicily and Italy,
and from the older Greek states, as Sparta and Athens, are rare, being
replaced by those from Asia Minor and the newer towns of the Greek
mainland. This falling off of interest in the games was largely due
to professionalism. In the second century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, we begin to read in
the inscriptions of περιοδονῖκαι, <i>i. e.</i>, victors winning prizes at all the
four national games, a sure indication of the professional spirit. Even
Pausanias mentions two such victors.<a id="FNanchor_2438"></a><a href="#Footnote_2438" class="fnanchor">2438</a></p>

<p>From these inscribed base-fragments, we have knowledge of 61 victors
(63 monuments)<a id="FNanchor_2439"></a><a href="#Footnote_2439" class="fnanchor">2439</a> who had statues erected to them, though they
are not named in the lists of Pausanias. Of the 192 monuments mentioned
by Pausanias, 40 are known to us from recovered fragments of
bases and statues. So if we assume the same ratio between known and
unknown for those not mentioned by Pausanias, we should have the
proportion 40 : 192 : : 63 : <i>x</i>, where <i>x</i> would equal 302, making a grand

<h3>OLYMPIC VICTOR MONUMENTS ERECTED OUTSIDE OLYMPIA.</h3>

<p>In Chapter I, we showed that frequently statues or other monuments
were erected in their native towns as a part of the honor paid to Olympic
victors. We shall now give a list of all such monuments set up in
various parts of the Greek world which are known to us from notices in
ancient literature and from inscriptions.<a id="FNanchor_2441"></a><a href="#Footnote_2441" class="fnanchor">2441</a> These, like the statues in
the Altis, range in date from the seventh century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> to the fourth
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span>, and offer still greater variety in the kinds of dedication. It will
be best to arrange the list as far as possible chronologically and in
numerical sequence, adding the authorities for the dates of the various
victories in the footnotes.<a id="FNanchor_2442"></a><a href="#Footnote_2442" class="fnanchor">2442</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">362</a></span></p>

<p>Victors with monuments of the seventh century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>:</p>

<p>1. Chionis, of Sparta.<a id="FNanchor_2443"></a><a href="#Footnote_2443" class="fnanchor">2443</a> Besides his statue by Myron and the tablet
containing a list of his victories at Olympia mentioned by Pausanias
(VI, 13.2), the same writer records a similar tablet in Sparta, erected
near the royal tomb of the Agids, likewise set up by his townspeople
(III, 14.3). The Spartan tablet, like the monuments in his honor at
Olympia, was doubtless set up long after the victory, about Ols. 77
or 78 (&#8239;=&#8239;472 or 468 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).</p>

<p>2. Kylon, of Athens.<a id="FNanchor_2444"></a><a href="#Footnote_2444" class="fnanchor">2444</a> Pausanias records that a bronze statue of
this victor stood upon the Athenian Akropolis, erected, as he supposes,
in honor of his beauty and reputation as an Olympic victor (I, 28.1).
Kylon was the leader of the well-known conspiracy of 632 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, when
he tried to make himself tyrant of Athens.<a id="FNanchor_2445"></a><a href="#Footnote_2445" class="fnanchor">2445</a> Furtwaengler has proposed
the theory that this monument was not set up in honor of Kylon
by the Athenians, as Pausanias says, but that it was a dedication by
his family after his Olympic victory.<a id="FNanchor_2446"></a><a href="#Footnote_2446" class="fnanchor">2446</a> A. Schaefer,<a id="FNanchor_2447"></a><a href="#Footnote_2447" class="fnanchor">2447</a> however, more
justly believed that the statue was an expiatory offering for the massacre
of Kylon’s companions on the Akropolis,<a id="FNanchor_2448"></a><a href="#Footnote_2448" class="fnanchor">2448</a> set up in the time of Perikles,
the date of which would account for the “beauty” of the statue.
Still another scholar<a id="FNanchor_2449"></a><a href="#Footnote_2449" class="fnanchor">2449</a> believes that Pausanias’ remark was called forth
by the epigram on the statue.<a id="FNanchor_2450"></a><a href="#Footnote_2450" class="fnanchor">2450</a></p>

<p>3. Hipposthenes, of Sparta.<a id="FNanchor_2451"></a><a href="#Footnote_2451" class="fnanchor">2451</a> Pausanias records that a temple was
dedicated to him in Sparta, where he received divine worship (III, 15.7).
It has been argued that the words of Pausanias (<i>l. c.</i>) show that Hipposthenes
here was worshiped only in the character of Poseidon,
whose epithet was ἵππιος (<i>cf.</i> P., I, 30.4).<a id="FNanchor_2452"></a><a href="#Footnote_2452" class="fnanchor">2452</a></p>

<p class="p padt05">Of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>:</p>

<p>4. Hetoimokles, son of Hipposthenes of Sparta.<a id="FNanchor_2453"></a><a href="#Footnote_2453" class="fnanchor">2453</a> Pausanias mentions
a statue of this victor at Sparta (III, 13.9).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">363</a></span></p>

<p>5. Arrhachion, of Phigalia.<a id="FNanchor_2454"></a><a href="#Footnote_2454" class="fnanchor">2454</a> Pausanias records the stone statue in
the archaic pose, and with weathered inscription, erected to this victor in
the market-place at Phigalia (VIII, 40.1), which we have discussed at
length in the preceding chapter (Fig. <a href="#f79">79</a>).</p>

<p>6. Kimon, the son of Stesagoras, of Athens.<a id="FNanchor_2455"></a><a href="#Footnote_2455" class="fnanchor">2455</a> Aelian mentions
αἱ Κίμωνος ἵπποι χαλκαῖ, very true to the originals, in Athens,<a id="FNanchor_2456"></a><a href="#Footnote_2456" class="fnanchor">2456</a> which
seem to have been set up in honor of his three chariot victories at
Olympia. His first victory was won when he was in banishment at
the hands of the tyrant Peisistratos, son of Hippokrates. Having entered
his horses under the tyrant’s name for the second contest, he was
in consequence recalled, and a third time entered them and won under
his own name.<a id="FNanchor_2457"></a><a href="#Footnote_2457" class="fnanchor">2457</a> The pseudo-Andokides confuses this older Kimon
with the younger, when he calls the latter an Olympic victor.<a id="FNanchor_2458"></a><a href="#Footnote_2458" class="fnanchor">2458</a> Similarly
a scholiast on Aristophanes<a id="FNanchor_2459"></a><a href="#Footnote_2459" class="fnanchor">2459</a> confuses him with Megakles, who
won a victory τεθρίππῳ in Ol. 47 (&#8239;=&#8239;592 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_2460"></a><a href="#Footnote_2460" class="fnanchor">2460</a></p>

<p>7. Philippos, son of Boutakides, of Kroton.<a id="FNanchor_2461"></a><a href="#Footnote_2461" class="fnanchor">2461</a> The people of Egesta
in Sicily erected a shrine over his grave in their town, and paid him
divine honors on account of his beauty, in which he surpassed all his
contemporaries.<a id="FNanchor_2462"></a><a href="#Footnote_2462" class="fnanchor">2462</a></p>

<p class="p padt05">Of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>:</p>

<p>8. Astylos, or Astyalos, of Kroton.<a id="FNanchor_2463"></a><a href="#Footnote_2463" class="fnanchor">2463</a> Besides mentioning his statue
by Pythagoras of Rhegion at Olympia, Pausanias in the same passage
(VI, 13.1) mentions another in the temple of Lakinian Hera near Kroton,
which his fellow-townsmen pulled down in anger, because he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">364</a></span>
called himself a Syracusan in order to please the Sicilian tyrant Hiero.<a id="FNanchor_2464"></a><a href="#Footnote_2464" class="fnanchor">2464</a>
Collignon believes that the statue at Kroton was also a copy of the
work of Pythagoras at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_2465"></a><a href="#Footnote_2465" class="fnanchor">2465</a></p>

<p>9. Euthymos, son of Astykles, of Lokroi Epizephyrioi in South
Italy.<a id="FNanchor_2466"></a><a href="#Footnote_2466" class="fnanchor">2466</a> In addition to his statue at Olympia by Pythagoras, mentioned
by Pausanias (VI, 6.4–6),<a id="FNanchor_2467"></a><a href="#Footnote_2467" class="fnanchor">2467</a> we know of another statue by Pythagoras
set up in Lokroi in honor of this victor.<a id="FNanchor_2468"></a><a href="#Footnote_2468" class="fnanchor">2468</a> According to Kallimachos,
both statues were struck by lightning at the same time. Other writers
tell wondrous tales of this boxer.<a id="FNanchor_2469"></a><a href="#Footnote_2469" class="fnanchor">2469</a></p>

<p>10. Theagenes, son of Timosthenes, of Thasos, one of the most
famous Olympic victors.<a id="FNanchor_2470"></a><a href="#Footnote_2470" class="fnanchor">2470</a> Besides his statue at Olympia by Glaukias
of Aegina (VI, 11.2 and 9), Pausanias says that he knows of many other
places in Greece and elsewhere where images of this victor were set up
(VI, 11.9), and records one at Thasos to which the Thasians sacrificed
as to a god (VI, 11.6). The story which he tells about this Thasian
statue being scourged and falling on the enemy of Theagenes is also
recounted at greater length by Dio Chrysostom<a id="FNanchor_2471"></a><a href="#Footnote_2471" class="fnanchor">2471</a> and is mentioned by
Eusebios.<a id="FNanchor_2472"></a><a href="#Footnote_2472" class="fnanchor">2472</a> Lucian says that the statue cured fevers, just as did
that of Polydamas at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_2473"></a><a href="#Footnote_2473" class="fnanchor">2473</a> Studniczka has argued that the
statues at Thasos and elsewhere were set up to honor the hero and not
the victor.<a id="FNanchor_2474"></a><a href="#Footnote_2474" class="fnanchor">2474</a></p>

<p>11. Ladas, of Sparta.<a id="FNanchor_2475"></a><a href="#Footnote_2475" class="fnanchor">2475</a> Two fourth-century epigrams celebrate the
fleetness of Ladas, and the second names Myron as the statuary of a
bronze statue of him.<a id="FNanchor_2476"></a><a href="#Footnote_2476" class="fnanchor">2476</a> Pausanias mentions a statue of the same victor
in the temple of Apollo Lykios in Argos (II, 19.7). Whether the latter
statue was identical with the one named in the epigram can not be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365">365</a></span>
finally determined.<a id="FNanchor_2477"></a><a href="#Footnote_2477" class="fnanchor">2477</a> Pausanias refers to a stadion of Ladas, situated
between Mantinea and Orchomenos in Arkadia, in which Ladas practiced
running (VIII, 12.5), and also to his grave between Belemina and Sparta
(III, 21.1).</p>

<p>12. Kallias, son of Didymias of Athens.<a id="FNanchor_2478"></a><a href="#Footnote_2478" class="fnanchor">2478</a> Apart from his statue at
Olympia made by the Athenian painter and sculptor Mikon, mentioned
by Pausanias (VI, 6.1),<a id="FNanchor_2479"></a><a href="#Footnote_2479" class="fnanchor">2479</a> there was a dedication to him at Athens,
as we learn from the preserved inscription, which enumerates his
thirteen victories at Olympia and elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_2480"></a><a href="#Footnote_2480" class="fnanchor">2480</a></p>

<p>13. Diagoras, son of Damagetos, of Rhodes, the most famous of
Greek boxers.<a id="FNanchor_2481"></a><a href="#Footnote_2481" class="fnanchor">2481</a> In addition to his statue at Olympia by Kallikles,
son of Theokosmos of Megara, mentioned by Pausanias (VI, 7.1–2)
as standing among the group of statues of his sons and grandsons, we
learn from the scholiast on Pindar, <i>Ol.</i> VII, Argum., who quotes
Gorgon as his authority,<a id="FNanchor_2482"></a><a href="#Footnote_2482" class="fnanchor">2482</a> that this ode, which celebrated the Olympic
victory of Diagoras, was attached in golden letters to the walls of the
temple of Athena at Lindos.</p>

<p>14. Agias, of Pharsalos.<a id="FNanchor_2483"></a><a href="#Footnote_2483" class="fnanchor">2483</a> We have already, in Ch. VI, discussed the
group of marble statues set up at Delphi by Daochos of Pharsalos in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366">366</a></span>
honor of his ancestors who had won in various athletic contests, which
was discovered by the French excavators there in 1894. We there
mentioned that Preuner found the same metrical inscription which
appeared on the base of the statue of Agias, the best preserved of the
group (Pl. <a href="#p28">28</a> and Fig. <a href="#f68">68</a>), in the journal of Stackelberg,<a id="FNanchor_2484"></a><a href="#Footnote_2484" class="fnanchor">2484</a> who had
copied it in the early part of the nineteenth century from a base in Pharsalos
which has since disappeared. This Thessalian inscription contained
the additional words that Lysippos of Sikyon was the sculptor.
In both inscriptions the victories of Agias at Olympia and elsewhere
are noted. Thus we know of two statues of Agias, one at Delphi, the
other at Pharsalos, both presumably by Lysippos. Preuner also thinks
that a third statue may have stood in Olympia.</p>

<p>15. Cheimon, of Argos.<a id="FNanchor_2485"></a><a href="#Footnote_2485" class="fnanchor">2485</a> In mentioning the statue of Cheimon at
Olympia by the sculptor Naukydes of Argos, Pausanias, in the same
passage (VI, 9.3), records another which once stood in Argos, but was
later removed to the temple of Peace in Rome.<a id="FNanchor_2486"></a><a href="#Footnote_2486" class="fnanchor">2486</a></p>

<p>16. Leon, son of Antikleidas (or Antalkidas), of Sparta.<a id="FNanchor_2487"></a><a href="#Footnote_2487" class="fnanchor">2487</a> A fragment
of Polemon<a id="FNanchor_2488"></a><a href="#Footnote_2488" class="fnanchor">2488</a> mentions a statue of this victor. It may have stood in
Olympia, as Foerster without good grounds assumes, or it may have
stood elsewhere.</p>

<p>17. Eubotas (Eubatas or Eubatos), of Kyrene.<a id="FNanchor_2489"></a><a href="#Footnote_2489" class="fnanchor">2489</a> Besides his statue
at Olympia recorded by Pausanias (VI, 8.3), we learn of another set
up at Kyrene by the victor’s wife for his devotion.<a id="FNanchor_2490"></a><a href="#Footnote_2490" class="fnanchor">2490</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367">367</a></span></p>

<p>18. Promachos, son of Dryon, of Pellene in Achaia.<a id="FNanchor_2491"></a><a href="#Footnote_2491" class="fnanchor">2491</a> Pausanias
not only mentions a bronze statue of this victor at Olympia (VI, 8.5–6),
but also records one of stone dedicated likewise by his townsmen in the
Old Gymnasion of Pellene (VII, 27.5).</p>

<p class="p padt05">Of the fifth or fourth centuries <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>:</p>

<p>19. An unknown victor, of Argos or (?) Tegea.<a id="FNanchor_2492"></a><a href="#Footnote_2492" class="fnanchor">2492</a> Aristotle mentions
an inscription from a statue of an Olympic victor in two passages of
his <i>Rhetoric</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2493"></a><a href="#Footnote_2493" class="fnanchor">2493</a> This epigram was repeated by Aristophanes of Byzantion,<a id="FNanchor_2494"></a><a href="#Footnote_2494" class="fnanchor">2494</a>
who wrongly ascribed it to Simonides.<a id="FNanchor_2495"></a><a href="#Footnote_2495" class="fnanchor">2495</a> Where this statue
stood can not be determined.</p>

<p class="p padt05">Of the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>:</p>

<p>20. Kyniska, daughter of Archidamos I, of Sparta.<a id="FNanchor_2496"></a><a href="#Footnote_2496" class="fnanchor">2496</a> Pausanias,
before mentioning the monumental group at Olympia by Apellas of
Megara, which consisted of the statues of Kyniska and her charioteer
standing beside a huge bronze chariot and horses (VI. 1.6), and the
small bronze chariot by the same sculptor, set up in her honor in the
vestibule of the temple of Zeus (V, 12.5), records that there was a
shrine in Sparta at Plane-tree Grove, near the youths’ exercise ground,
erected to the heroine Kyniska (III, 15.1). This latter dedication,
therefore, was not properly a victor monument, though Pausanias in
the same book says that Kyniska was the first Greek woman to train
horses and to win a prize at Olympia (III, 8.1).</p>

<p>21. Euryleonis, a victress of Sparta.<a id="FNanchor_2497"></a><a href="#Footnote_2497" class="fnanchor">2497</a> Pausanias says that she had
a statue in her native city near the so-called Σκήνωμα, “Tent” (III,
17.6). Curtius has suggested that this may be the small building
mentioned by Thukydides as the place where King Pausanias took
refuge when pursued by the ephors.<a id="FNanchor_2498"></a><a href="#Footnote_2498" class="fnanchor">2498</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368">368</a></span></p>

<p>22. Archias, son of Eukles, of Hybla.<a id="FNanchor_2499"></a><a href="#Footnote_2499" class="fnanchor">2499</a> An epigram in the <i>Greek
Anthology</i><a id="FNanchor_2500"></a><a href="#Footnote_2500" class="fnanchor">2500</a> speaks of a statue of this victor at Delphi.</p>

<p>23. [Phil]okrates, son of Antiphon, of Athens (deme of Krioa).<a id="FNanchor_2501"></a><a href="#Footnote_2501" class="fnanchor">2501</a>
An inscribed base of the statue of this victor has been found in Athens.<a id="FNanchor_2502"></a><a href="#Footnote_2502" class="fnanchor">2502</a></p>

<p>24. An unknown victor. An inscribed base, found near the Portico
of Attalos in Athens, records the victories of an unknown athlete at
several games, including one in the παγκράτιον ἀνδρῶν at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_2503"></a><a href="#Footnote_2503" class="fnanchor">2503</a></p>

<p>25. Phorystas, son of Thriax (or Triax), of (?) Tanagra.<a id="FNanchor_2504"></a><a href="#Footnote_2504" class="fnanchor">2504</a> The inscribed
base of the statue of this victor, giving Kaphisias of Bœotia as
the sculptor, has been discovered in the ruins of Tanagra.<a id="FNanchor_2505"></a><a href="#Footnote_2505" class="fnanchor">2505</a> His brother
Pammachos won παγκράτιον παίδων at Nemea, and had a statue at
Thebes, the work of Teisikrates, the inscribed base of which has been
recovered.<a id="FNanchor_2506"></a><a href="#Footnote_2506" class="fnanchor">2506</a></p>

<p>26. Aristophon, son of Lysinos, of Athens.<a id="FNanchor_2507"></a><a href="#Footnote_2507" class="fnanchor">2507</a> Besides his statue at
Olympia, set up at the cost of the people of Athens, mentioned by Pausanias
(VI, 13.11; <i>cf.</i> VI, 14.1), we have the inscription from the
base of another which was set up on the Athenian Akropolis.<a id="FNanchor_2508"></a><a href="#Footnote_2508" class="fnanchor">2508</a></p>

<p>27. Attalos, father of King Attalos I,<a id="FNanchor_2509"></a><a href="#Footnote_2509" class="fnanchor">2509</a> of Pergamon.<a id="FNanchor_2510"></a><a href="#Footnote_2510" class="fnanchor">2510</a> The inscribed

<p>Of the first century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span>:</p>

<p>28. Xenodamos, of Antikyra in Phokis.<a id="FNanchor_2512"></a><a href="#Footnote_2512" class="fnanchor">2512</a> Pausanias mentions a
bronze statue of this victor in the Old Gymnasion at Antikyra (X,
36.9). G. Hirschfeld<a id="FNanchor_2513"></a><a href="#Footnote_2513" class="fnanchor">2513</a> had objected to the statement of Pausanias, in
the passage cited, “that this was the only Olympiad omitted in the
Elean register,” because of its inconsistency with other passages which
state that in the 8th Olympiad,<a id="FNanchor_2514"></a><a href="#Footnote_2514" class="fnanchor">2514</a> in the 34th,<a id="FNanchor_2515"></a><a href="#Footnote_2515" class="fnanchor">2515</a> and in the 104th,<a id="FNanchor_2516"></a><a href="#Footnote_2516" class="fnanchor">2516</a> the
games were celebrated by intruders, and not by the Eleans, and
hence these Olympiads were regarded as invalid and were not entered
in the Elean registers. However, as Frazer points out,<a id="FNanchor_2517"></a><a href="#Footnote_2517" class="fnanchor">2517</a> the case with
Ol. 211 was different. It was doubtless celebrated by the Eleans
themselves and its validity was not questioned, but either it was
never entered in the register, or, if entered, was later struck out.
Africanus (<i>cf.</i> Philostratos)<a id="FNanchor_2518"></a><a href="#Footnote_2518" class="fnanchor">2518</a> says that the celebration of this Olympiad,
which should have fallen 65 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span>, was deferred two years to favor
Nero, who in 67 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;D.</span> received prizes in six events, including the ten-horse
chariot-race.<a id="FNanchor_2519"></a><a href="#Footnote_2519" class="fnanchor">2519</a> The Eleans, later being ashamed of thus favoring
the tyrant, probably removed Ol. 211 from the register after his death.
It may be that for the same reason statues of victors of that Olympiad
were not set up in the Altis, which would explain why that of Xenodamos
was set up in his native city, where Pausanias saw it. Not
finding his name in the Elean register, Pausanias would reason that
this victory fell in the disgraced Ol. 211.<a id="FNanchor_2520"></a><a href="#Footnote_2520" class="fnanchor">2520</a></p>

<p>28a. Titos Phlabios Artemidoros, son of Artemidoros, of Adana in
Kilikia.<a id="FNanchor_2521"></a><a href="#Footnote_2521" class="fnanchor">2521</a> The inscribed marble tablet from the base of the statue which
this victor erected in Naples in honor of his father Artemidoros, son of
Athenodoros, is preserved. It contains a list of his own many victories
in παγκράτιον and πάλη in games held in Greece, Italy, Asia Minor, and
Egypt. Though the statue was erected to his father, the long inscription
shows that it was intended quite as much to celebrate his own
athletic prowess.<a id="FNanchor_2522"></a><a href="#Footnote_2522" class="fnanchor">2522</a></p>

<p>29. Titos Phlabios Metrobios, son of Demetrios, of Iasos, Karia.<a id="FNanchor_2523"></a><a href="#Footnote_2523" class="fnanchor">2523</a>

<p>30. Sarapion, of Alexandria, Egypt.<a id="FNanchor_2525"></a><a href="#Footnote_2525" class="fnanchor">2525</a> Pausanias mentions two statues
of this victor, which stood on either side of the entrance to the
Gymnasion in Elis known as the Maltho. He adds that they were
erected by the Eleans in gratitude for the bestowal of corn in a time of
famine (VI, 23.6). He is not to be confounded with other victors of
the same name.<a id="FNanchor_2526"></a><a href="#Footnote_2526" class="fnanchor">2526</a></p>

<p class="p padt05">We have records of other monuments erected to victors, but it is not
clear whether the victories recorded were won at Olympia or elsewhere.
We list the following three doubtful cases, which have already been
noted in earlier chapters:</p>

<p>1. Epicharinos. Pausanias mentions the statue Ἐπιχαρίνου ὁπλιτοδρομεῖν
ἀσκήσαντος, by the sculptor Kritios, as standing upon the
Athenian Akropolis (I, 23.9). The inscribed base of this monument
was found in 1839, between the Propylaia and the Parthenon.<a id="FNanchor_2552"></a><a href="#Footnote_2552" class="fnanchor">2552</a> The
inscription states that the statue was the joint work of Kritios (thus
correcting the spelling Κριτίας of Pausanias) and Nesiotes. It was,
therefore, a work of the first half of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, the date
of the sculptors of the <i>Tyrannicides</i> (Fig. <a href="#f32">32</a>). Ross added the word
ὁπλιτοδρόμος after the name in the inscription. Michaelis,<a id="FNanchor_2553"></a><a href="#Footnote_2553" class="fnanchor">2553</a> however,
has inserted the name of the victor’s father. Wilamowitz<a id="FNanchor_2554"></a><a href="#Footnote_2554" class="fnanchor">2554</a> went
further and assumed that Polemon, from whom Pausanias derived
the account, had already falsely restored the inscription and that the
statue did not represent Epicharinos, but another victor. This theory
has been rightly controverted by many scholars.<a id="FNanchor_2555"></a><a href="#Footnote_2555" class="fnanchor">2555</a> It is clear that
Pausanias got his information from the monument, and not from the
inscription.</p>

<p>2. Hermolykos, son of Euthoinos or Euthynos. Pausanias mentions
the statue of the pancratiast Hermolykos as standing on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373">373</a></span>
Akropolis at Athens (I, 23.10). This was probably Hermolykos the
pancratiast, who is recorded by Herodotos as having distinguished
himself at the battle of Mykale in 479 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, and as having been afterwards
killed in battle at Kyrnos in Euboia and buried at Geraistos.<a id="FNanchor_2556"></a><a href="#Footnote_2556" class="fnanchor">2556</a>
Some scholars have advocated the theory that the portrait statue here
mentioned by Pausanias was none other than the statue which stood on
the Akropolis on the base which was discovered in 1839, dedicated by
Hermolykos, the son of Diitrephes, the work of the sculptor Kresilas,<a id="FNanchor_2557"></a><a href="#Footnote_2557" class="fnanchor">2557</a>
and that the Periegete mistook the latter for the one mentioned by Herodotos.<a id="FNanchor_2558"></a><a href="#Footnote_2558" class="fnanchor">2558</a>
However, Frazer finds this explanation “arbitrary and highly
improbable,” and believes that the base in question supported the
statue of Diitrephes, pierced with arrows, also mentioned by Pausanias
(I, 23.3).<a id="FNanchor_2559"></a><a href="#Footnote_2559" class="fnanchor">2559</a> Kirchhoff distinguished not only the statue of Hermolykos
mentioned by Pausanias and the dedication of Hermolykos revealed by
the recovered base, but both of these from the statue of the wounded
man mentioned by Pliny (<i>H. N.</i>, XXXIV, 74). While J. Six assumed
that Hermolykos, son of Diitrephes, dedicated the Kresilæan statue in
honor of his grandfather Hermolykos, son of Euthoinos, and that Pausanias
wrongly gathered from the inscribed base that the statue represented
Diitrephes,<a id="FNanchor_2560"></a><a href="#Footnote_2560" class="fnanchor">2560</a> Furtwaengler believed that Diitrephes was the older
warrior of the name, mentioned by Thukydides,<a id="FNanchor_2561"></a><a href="#Footnote_2561" class="fnanchor">2561</a> and that Pausanias,
who knew nothing of him, wrongly connected his statue with the
younger one of that name.<a id="FNanchor_2562"></a><a href="#Footnote_2562" class="fnanchor">2562</a></p>

<p>3. Isokrates, son of Theodoros, of Athens. The pseudo-Plutarch
mentions a bronze statue of Isokrates, in the form of a παῖς κελητίζων,
on the Athenian Akropolis.<a id="FNanchor_2563"></a><a href="#Footnote_2563" class="fnanchor">2563</a> As the orator was born in 436 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>,
his youthful victory among the horse-racers must have occurred about
420 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374">374</a></span></p>

<h3>SUMMARY OF RESULTS.</h3>

<p>We have found, then, from the literary sources examined, that there
are at least 44 Olympic victors, to whom a total of 47 monuments were
erected outside Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_2564"></a><a href="#Footnote_2564" class="fnanchor">2564</a> These monuments were of various kinds—1
inscribed tablet, 1 Pindaric ode engrossed on a temple wall, 3
temples or shrines, 37 statues (one of them apparently iconic), bronze
horses (? quadriga), and 4 dedications which are not further described.
Thus the bulk of these monuments, as of those at Olympia, consisted
of statues. Of the 29 monuments erected to 27 victors in the pre-Christian
centuries, 3 were dedicated in the seventh,<a id="FNanchor_2565"></a><a href="#Footnote_2565" class="fnanchor">2565</a> 4 in the sixth,
13 (to 11 victors) in the fifth, 1 in the fifth or fourth, 6 in the fourth,<a id="FNanchor_2566"></a><a href="#Footnote_2566" class="fnanchor">2566</a>
1 in the fourth or third, and 1 in the third. There is no record of
such a dedication in the second and first centuries <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> Of the 14
monuments erected to 13 victors known to belong to the post-Christian
centuries, 4 (to 3 victors) belong to the first, 5 to the second, 3
to the third and 2 to the fourth; 4 others were set up to 4 victors
whose dates can not be determined. Of other monuments mentioned
(though not included in our figures) 3 may or may not have been
erected to Olympic victors. We find that the greatest number of
dedications was made in the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, just as we found was
the case in regard to those at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_2567"></a><a href="#Footnote_2567" class="fnanchor">2567</a> Of these victors, 10 also
had monuments at Olympia. The total number of Olympic victor
monuments, therefore, at Olympia and elsewhere of which we have
record, amounts to 302.<a id="FNanchor_2568"></a><a href="#Footnote_2568" class="fnanchor">2568</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">375</a></span></p>

<h3>STATISTICS OF OLYMPIC VICTOR STATUARIES.</h3>

<p>In conclusion, we shall briefly summarize the number and dates of
the sculptors of Olympic victor monuments who are known to us from
all sources.<a id="FNanchor_2569"></a><a href="#Footnote_2569" class="fnanchor">2569</a> Pausanias names 52 such sculptors, who made 102 of the
192 monuments listed by him. Of the 42 “honor” statues erected in
the Altis to 35 men, Pausanias mentions only two sculptors, Lysippos,
who also appears among the victor statuaries, and Mikon of Syracuse,
who does not.<a id="FNanchor_2570"></a><a href="#Footnote_2570" class="fnanchor">2570</a> Pliny names 24, or nearly one-half of the athlete
sculptors mentioned by Pausanias.<a id="FNanchor_2571"></a><a href="#Footnote_2571" class="fnanchor">2571</a> No new name of an artist appears
either on the inscribed bases found at Olympia and referred to the
monuments recorded by Pausanias, or on the 63 bases discovered
there, which can not be so referred. Of the 52 sculptors known to us
from Pausanias and inscriptions, the dates can be assigned definitely
or approximately thus: of the seventh century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, none; of the sixth
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, second half, 2; end, 2; of the end of the sixth and beginning
of the fifth centuries <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, 1; of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, first half, 9;
middle, 4; second half, 3; end, 2; of the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, first half,
11; middle, 1; second half, 2; end, 3; of the end of the fourth and
beginning of the third centuries <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, 3; of the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>,
first half, 1; second half, 1; end, 2; of the end of the third and beginning
of the second centuries <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, 1; of the second century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, first half, 2.
No sculptor is named who lived certainly later than the second century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> In addition to these results, 1 sculptor can be assigned only
roughly to the period subsequent to Alexander the Great, and the epoch
of still another can not be determined. Of the 37 statues listed above
as erected to Olympic victors outside Olympia—<i>i. e.&gt;</i>, the major portion
of the whole number of 47 monuments of various sorts set up in honor
of 44 victors—the names of only four artists are known. Three of
these—Myron, Pythagoras of Rhegion, and Lysippos—also worked at
Olympia. The name, therefore, of only one new sculptor, Kaphisias
of Bœotia, who lived in the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, can be added from
this source, which makes the grand total of victor statuaries known
to us 53.</p>

young princes, who led the “sheltered life,” were often represented on
monuments as pale, though red was the more usual color: see Hall, <i>op.

the agrimi (wild goat) is startled and springs away; then the lion

the beast’s hind quarter and the other raised to strike: see Evans,

He cites the Smyrna relief above mentioned (in the Ashmolean Museum

acrobatic scene. See J. Baunack, <i>Rhein. Mus.</i>, XXXVIII, 1883, pp. 293

theory of the origin of the Olympic Festival in the funeral games in
honor of Pelops does not explain all the legends of the games nor all
the peculiar customs of the festival, and because of the inadequate
character of the literary evidence (the earliest mention of it being a
Delphic oracle quoted by Phlegon, <i>F. H. G.</i>, p. 604; <i>cf.</i> Clem. Alex.,
<i>Protrept</i>, II, 34, p. 29), it has been attacked by F. M. Cornford
(in Miss Harrison’s <i>Themis</i>, pp. 212 f.) and others. These scholars
have tried to find the origin of the Olympic games rather in a ritual
contest of succession to the throne, the honors extended to a victor
being held to prove his kingly or divine character. The theory was
first proposed by A. B. Cook, The European Sky God, <i>Folk Lore</i>, 1904,
and has recently been elaborated by Frazer in his <i>Golden Bough</i>,<sup>3</sup>
III, pp. 89 f., who has attempted to harmonize it with his earlier
funeral theory. The inadequacy of the newer theory has been shown by E.

chest made to save the infant Kypselos, father of Periandros and future
tyrant of Corinth, and that it was dedicated at Olympia by the Kypselid
family (for the story, see Hdt., V, 92), the chest would belong to the
eighth century B.&nbsp;C., and must have been dedicated before 586–5 B.
C., when the Kypselid dynasty ended at Corinth; see Busolt, <i>Griech.
Gesch.</i>,<sup>2</sup> I, pp. 638 and 657. However, the chest at Olympia had
nothing to do with the legendary one, but was merely a richly decorated
offering to the gods, the work of a Corinthian artist of the end of the
seventh or beginning of the sixth century B.&nbsp;C., and one who knew the
epic poems well.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_314"></a><a href="#FNanchor_314"><span class="label">314</span></a> The age of boy victors at Olympia seems to have been 17–20: see <i>Inschr. v. Ol.</i>, 56, ll. II f.
(referring to the order of the <i>Augustalia</i>, or Σεβαστὰ ἰσολύμπια, celebrated in Naples, which
were modeled after those of Olympia, <i>cf.</i> <i>C. I. G.</i>, III, 5805). Archippos of Mytilene won the
crown for boxing at Olympia, Delphi, Nemea, and on the Isthmus among the men at not over
twenty years of age: P., VI, 15.1; <i>Inschr. v. Ol.</i>, 173; he won sometime between Ols. (?) 115 and
125 (&#8239;=&#8239;320 and 280 B.&nbsp;C.): Hyde, 140; Foerster, 757 (undated). Since Pausanias mentions this
as a remarkable record, we should suspect his statement that the boy runner Damiskos of
Messene was but twelve when he won the stade-race: VI, 2.10; he won Ol. 103 (&#8239;=&#8239;368 B.&nbsp;C.):
Afr.; Hyde, 20; Foerster, 343. Another victor, of unknown date, Nikasylos of Rhodes, was disqualified
when eighteen years old from entering the boys’ wrestling match because of his age,
and so entered that of the men: P., VI, 14.1–2; Hyde, 125; Foerster, 787. He died at twenty.
Such inconsistencies in Pausanias’ account show that the Hellanodikai exercised some discretion
in their judgment, taking into consideration not merely age, but size and strength.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_417"></a><a href="#FNanchor_417"><span class="label">417</span></a> At the beginning of his description of Elis (V, 1.2), Pausanias says that 217 years had passed
since the restoration of Corinth. As that event fell in 44 B.&nbsp;C., he was writing his fifth book in
174 A.&nbsp;D., <i>i. e.</i>, in the reign of Marcus Aurelius. With this date other chronological references
in his work agree. That the fifth book was written before the sixth is deduced from a comparison
of V, 14.6 with VI, 22.8 f. Though the sixth book, therefore, can not have been composed
earlier than 174 A.&nbsp;D., it may, of course, have been written much later. On the dates of the
various books, see Frazer, I, pp. xv f. On the great importance of Pausanias for the whole history
of Greek art, see C. Robert, <i>Pausanias als Schriftsteller</i>, 1909, p. 1.</p></div>

Scherer, p. 20, n. 1 (following Krause, I, pp. 405 and 501, n. 18) thought that the words of Thukydides
(τὸ δὲ πάλαι) referred to the time antedating Ol. 15, and not later, and concluded that in
wrestling (introduced in Ol. 18 = 708 B.&nbsp;C.) and boxing (introduced in Ol. 23 = 688 B.&nbsp;C.) the
contestants were always nude. Boeckh, however, rightly concluded that the historian meant
that in Ol. 15 only the runners laid off the loin-cloth, while other athletes did so just before his
day: <i>C. I. G.</i>, I, p. 554.</p></div>

idea escaping all scholars except, perhaps, Bluemner in his commentary on the <i>Laokoön</i> (p. 503).
Evidently Pliny, or his source, is explaining the discrepancy between ideal and portrait
statues as the result of an improbable rule, since the ancients applied little historical criticism to
art, and hence did not distinguish between works representing types and those representing
individuals. Dio Chrysostom, in his treatise Περὶ κάλλους (<i>Orat.</i>, XXI, 1, p. 501 R), tries to
explain the difference between early and late statues on the ground of physical degeneration
in the latter.</p></div>

monument of the victor, the inscribed base of which has been found: <i>Inschr. v. Ol.</i>, 154, though
Dittenberger wrongly refers it to Damasippos: Foerster, 812; Hyde, pp. 53–4. The same authority
refers no. 170 to the middle of the fourth century B.&nbsp;C., or a couple of decades later, because
of the lettering and orthography. The monument of no. 170 must, therefore, have been set up
long after the victory—about a century later.</p></div>

victors and not to portraits. Pausanias frequently uses the word εἰκών for ἀνδριάς (<i>e. g.</i>, III,

The interpretation of this disputed passage depends, of course, on the meaning of
<i>numerosior</i>, and whether we accept the curious statement of the manuscript that Myron surpassed
Poykleitos in symmetry, or, by omitting the <i>et</i> (with Sillig), make it mean just the contrary
and in harmony with the usual ancient view that symmetry was the salient characteristic of
Polykleitan art. The passage, then, would contrast the symmetry of Polykleitos with the
variety of Myron. This accords with Pliny’s use of <i>numerosus</i> elsewhere (<i>e. g.</i>, XXXV, 130

said that the attempt to recover and establish such a canon in Greek architecture is still unproved.
The subject is complicated and has led to very different views. Thus, while many scholars
have defended the theory of the canon (<i>e. g.</i>, Pennethorne, <i>Geom. and Optics of Anc. Arch.</i>, 1878;
Penrose, in Whibley, <i>Comp. to Gk. Stud.</i><sup>1</sup>, 1905, pp. 220–1; Ferguson, <i>Hist. Arch.</i>, ed. 1887, I, p.
251; P. Gardner, <i>Princ. Gk. Art.</i>, p. 21; Statham, <i>Short Crit. Hist. Arch.</i>, 1912, p. 130), others are
opposed, and believe that design in Greek architecture was a matter of feeling, and that the orders
were first reduced to formulæ in Roman days (<i>e. g.</i>, A. K. Porter, <i>Med. Arch.</i>, 1909, I, 9; Goodyear,
<i>Greek Refinements, Studies in Temperamental Arch.</i>, 1912, esp. p. 83, quoting Joseph Hoffer from
<i>Wiener Bauzeitung</i>, 1838). See on the subject a recent article by my pupil, Dr. A. W. Barker,

<p><a id="Footnote_665"></a><a href="#FNanchor_665"><span class="label">665</span></a> Long ago Turnebus (<i>Advers.</i>, 1580, p. 486) explained the word in the sense of ἔγκρισις ἀθλητῶν,
as used by Lucian, <i>pro Imag.</i>, 11; <i>cf.</i>, Cicero’s <i>probatio</i>, in his <i>de Off.</i>, I, 144. Most modern commentators,
however, refer the word to the statue, translating it “classical” or “chosen”: thus Urlichs,
<i>Chrest. Pl.</i>, 1857, p. 325; O. Jahn, Ueber die Kunsturteile des Plinius (<i>Ber. saechs. Ges. d. Wiss.</i>,
1850), p. 125; H. L. von Urlichs, <i>Blaetter f. d. bayr. Gymnasialsch.</i>, 1894, pp. 609 f., translates it
“klassisch” or “mustergueltig,” <i>i. e.</i>, serving as a pattern or standard. But the term was too well
known as an athletic one for it ever to have been applied to a statue. The present participle,
instead of the usual aorist (ἐγκριθείς), shows that Alkamenes’ statue represented an athlete in the
act of undergoing selection. The old emendation into ἐγχριόμενος has been recently defended by
Klein, <i>Praxiteles</i>, p. 50, who identifies Pliny’s statue with the Glyptothek <i>Oil-pourer</i> (Pl. 11); it
is discredited by the occurrence of the epithet <i>Encrinomenos</i> as a Roman proper name, <i>C. I. L.</i>,
V, <small>1</small>, 4429, which shows how familiar it was. See Jex-Blake, on the passage of Pliny.</p></div>

and the rivets which were used in welding the fragments together. He also colored it
to resemble bronze. The method used in the restoration is certainly open to objection, but not
to the extent asserted by certain scholars, <i>e. g.</i>, by von Mach, who asserts that no Greek statue
has received such unworthy treatment, and that the restoration makes it possible to refer the
statue to almost any age or admixture of influences: <i>Greek Sculpture, Its Spirit and Principles</i>,
p. 326. Much of the beauty of the statue, to be sure, is gone, but the style is not obscured. It
has been restored too full, which gives it a sensuous appearance. For the statue, before restoration,

that the connection is not literally true, even if considerations of chronology are not against it,
and derives the story of Hagelaïdas teaching Myron from the similarity between the work of
the two. For Polykleitos, see Pliny, <i>H. N.</i>, XXXIV, 55. The tradition that Hagelaïdas was the
master of Polykleitos has been unreasonably assailed by many scholars: <i>e. g.</i>, by Robert, <i>Arch.
Maerchen</i>, 1886, p. 97; Mahler, <i>Polyklet u. s. Sch.</i>, 3912, pp. 6 f.; Klein, I, p. 340; <i>cf.</i> II, p. 143;
<i>cf.</i> Springer-Michaelis, I, p. 210. Furtwaengler, <i>Mp.</i>, p. 196, <i>Mw.</i>, p. 380, believes it impossible
because of chronological difficulties, and assumes a sculptor of an intermediate generation
as the teacher of Polykleitos; he, followed by Mahler, <i>l. c.</i>, and Klein, I, 340, names Argeiadas
(mentioned in <i>I. G. B.</i>, no. 30) as this intermediate artist. However, he admits that the
statement is true in a general sense, since Polykleitos developed his canon from that of
Hagelaïdas: <i>cf.</i> <i>50stes Berl. Winckelmannsprogr.</i>, p. 149; Pfuhl, however, p. 2192, has shown
that the relationship is perfectly possible.</p></div>

of the name of Alkamenes, ascribing the gable statues and that of <i>Hera</i> at Phaleron (mentioned
by P., I, 1.5) to the elder one. Furtwaengler later retracted the theory of two artists and
assumed but one (<i>Mp.</i>, p. 90, n. 3; <i>Mw.</i>, p. 122 and n. 6). Koepp has shown that the <i>Hera</i> is
of no use in dating, since the story of Pausanias that the temple of Hera was destroyed by the
Persians is an invention (<i>Jb.</i>, V, 1890, p. 277). The idea of an elder Alkamenes based on the
inscription on a herm recently found in Pergamon (<i>A. A.</i>, 1904, fig. on p. 76) has also

finds it earlier than the remnants of the sculptures of the Hekatompedon and, because of the
delicate carving of the drapery and hair, despite its Attic features, calls it “typically Ionian in
its elaboration of detail.” However, I follow Overbeck’s date at the beginning of the fifth century

Pindar, <i>Ol.</i>, IX, 84; <i>Isthm.</i>, V, 62 (of wool); Boeckh, <i>Explic. ad Pind.</i>, p. 193. In the Iliad μίτρα
was the kilt or apron worn around the waist under the cuirass (a ζωστήρ being worn outside):
IV, 137; IV, 187; V, 857; etc. It was used also later as a wrestler’s girdle: <i>A. G.</i>, XV, 44;
and for women’s headbands: Alkm., I; <i>cf.</i> Eurip., <i>Bacchae</i>, 833. Athletes on vase-paintings
representing palæstra scenes often wear the fillet: <i>e. g.</i>, the wrestlers and other athletes on the
Philadelphia r.-f. kylix pictured in Fig. 50, have red bands in their hair. Later the μίτρα
was specially used of women; if of men, it was a sign of effeminacy: Aristoph., <i>Thesmophoriazusae</i>,
163. The home of the μίτρα appears to have been Asia, as it was commonly worn by
Asiatics: see Hdt., I, 195; VII, 62 (head-dress); Virgil, <i>Aen.</i>, IV, 216. We learn from Alkman

with a target, and such contests kept up in Thessaly to the time of Hadrian: Gardiner,
pp. 356–8. Throwing the javelin at a target from horseback is seen on a Panathenaic
amphora in the British Museum: Gardiner, p. 357, fig. 106; <i>J. H. S.</i>, XXVII, Pl. XX. Pindar
mentions javelin-throwing three times, and in each case the throw was for distance: <i>Nem.</i>, VII,
70–1; <i>Isthm.</i>, II, 35; <i>Pyth.</i>, I, 44. Lucian, in a passage referring to the pentathlon at Olympia,
says that athletes competed for distance: <i>Anacharsis</i>, 27. On this question, see Juethner, pp. 54 f.</p></div>

Furtwaengler, <i>l. c.</i>, found von Duhn’s view that the <i>Charioteer</i> is an original work of Pythagoras
untenable. He also combated his interpretation of πολύζαλος as a proper name, preferring
the suggestion of Washburn that it might be an adjective. However, in a former article (<i>Sitzb.
Muen. Akad.</i>, 1897, pp. 129 f.) he had emphasized the similarity between the statue and a bronze
statuette in London (<i>B. M. Bronzes</i>, 515 and Pl. XVI; <i>Sitzb.</i>, <i>l. c.</i>, Pl. V, two views) which he
believed was almost certainly a product of Magna Græcia. He found the style of the <i>Charioteer</i>
Ionic-Attic without Peloponnesian affiliations, and referred it to Amphion or to some unknown
artist of the circle of Kritios and Nesiotes. For a similar view, see Homolle, <i>Mon. Piot</i>, IV,
1897, p. 207. Pottier (<i>ap.</i> Homolle, <i>l. c.</i>) assigned it to Kalamis. <i>Cf.</i> also Lechat, <i>Pythagoras de

every artist is to a large extent a child of his age and circumstances. <i>Cf.</i> Jex-Blake, pp. xlviii f.,

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2094"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2094"><span class="label">2094</span></a> The Praxitelian <i>Hermes</i> similarly shows an unfinished treatment of the back hair; in fact the
entire back of the statue is carelessly done (<i>Bildw. v. Ol.</i>, p. 203, fig. 233), though chisel-rasps show
a subsequent attempt to better it. This condition led Treu at first (<i>Ausgrab. v. Ol.</i>, V, p. 10; followed
by Furtwaengler, <i>Mp.</i>, p. 308, n. 7; <i>Mw.</i>, p. 531, n. 3) to believe that the statue was made
at Olympia with regard to its position in the Heraion. Later (<i>Bildw. v. Ol.</i>, pp. 204–5) Treu
believed that this merely indicated that the statue was intended to stand against a wall; and
since the present base is not the original one (see Bulle, <i>apud</i> Purgold, <i>Ergebnisse v. Ol.</i>, II, pp.
157 f.), that the statue was not originally meant for the temple, but was moved thither, perhaps
in Nero’s day; <i>cf.</i> also Wernicke, <i>Jb.</i>, IX, 1894, pp. 108 f. For the <i>Hermes</i>, mentioned by P.,

<p><a id="Footnote_2140"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2140"><span class="label">2140</span></a> It was chiefly the preponderance of the lower part of the face over the upper, in consequence
of the large chin and strongly marked cheek-bones, that led Treu to predicate Peloponnesian rather
than Attic influence in the Tegea heads: <i>A. M.</i>, VI, 1881, p. 408. He found them Polykleitan
in character, as did also Graef, <i>l. c.</i>, p. 210, Furtwaengler, <i>Mp.</i>, p. 523, and Collignon, II, p.
238. L. R. Farnell, however, long ago combated the theory of Peloponnesian influence, and
found analogies in fifth-century Attic works of the time of Pheidias, as well as in works from the
beginning of the fourth century B.&nbsp;C.: see <i>J. H. S.</i>, VII, 1886, pp. 114 f.</p></div>

ὥσπερ ἔκ τινος ἐπιπνοίας κινηθεὶς εἰς τὴν τοῦ ἀγάλματος δημιουργίαν τὴν θεοφορίαν ἐφῆκε. The words
with which Diodoros (Fragm. 1, Bk. XXVI) characterized Praxiteles, as ὁ καταμίξας ἄκρως τοῖς
λιθίνοις ἔργοις τὰ τῆς ψυχῆς πάθη, apply much better to Skopas, for Praxiteles’ “emotions of the
soul” are mood and temperament rather than emotion and passion.</p></div>

several other female heads attributed to Skopas: <i>e. g.</i>, in the colossal one called <i>Artemisia</i> from
the Eastern pediment of the Mausoleion: Gardner, <i>Sculpt.</i>, Pl. LIX; in the head of an <i>Aphrodite</i>
found in the sea off Laurion: <i>J. H. S.</i>, XV, 1895, pp. 194f. and fig. (Aphrodite ?); in the
head of a goddess found south of the Akropolis (and in the copy of it in Berlin): Gardner, <i>Hbk.</i>,
p. 457, fig. 119; and in the Dresden statuette of a <i>Mænad</i>: Treu, <i>Mélanges Perrot</i>, Pl. V; Gardner,
<i>Sculpt.</i>, Pl. LII; etc.; they are also plainly visible in the <i>Demeter of Knidos</i>: Gardner,
<i>Sculpt.</i>, Pl. LIII; etc. These heads are discussed by Gardner, <i>Sculpt.</i>, pp. 190f., and are ascribed
by him to Skopas.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2144"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2144"><span class="label">2144</span></a> <i>J. H. S.</i>, XXVI, 1906, p. 174. Gardner (<i>ibid.</i>) does not explain this contrast in expression
between the <i>Atalanta</i> and the surrounding heroes on the analogy of the contrast in the calmness of
<i>Apollo</i> among the struggling <i>Lapiths</i> from the Olympia pediment, since the action in the torso of
<i>Atalanta</i> shows that she was no mere spectator. He finds the explanation rather in the sex and youth
of the heroine; for this reason he thinks that the sculptor did not represent her as sharing equally
with the others the passion of the combat. He finds a truer analogy in the contrast between calm
and passion in the <i>Lapiths</i> and <i>Centaurs</i> of the Parthenon metopes, where the human and bestial
are thus distinguished; just so the heroine-goddess is here distinguished from her human companions.
He also supposes that Skopas was not ready thus early in his career (just after 395 B.&nbsp;C.,
when the temple of Athena Alea was destroyed by fire) to apply his new extreme of expression to
female heads. However, it must not be overlooked that these male heads—because of their
marked individuality—presuppose a more mature genius, and so can just as well be assigned to
the period of the Arkadian revival of 370 B.&nbsp;C. It has recently been seriously disputed whether
the <i>Atalanta</i> should be assigned at all to the Eastern pediment, where the French excavators placed
it; thus Cultrera has looked upon it as an akroterion figure, while Thiersch and Neugebauer
have identified it with a single figure representing <i>Nike</i>. See Cultrera, <i>Atti dell’ Accad. dei
Lincei</i>, 1910, pp. 22f.; H. Thiersch, Zum Problem des Tegeatempels, <i>Jb.</i>, XXVIII, 1913, p.
270; Neugebauer, <i>Studien ueber Skopas</i>, Leipsic, 1913; the latter has argued that the head and
torso do not belong together, while Dugas has maintained the older view, that the turn and
position of the neck fit the torso: <i>Rev. de l’art anc. et mod.</i>, 1911, pp. 9f.</p></div>

to call the work under discussion not <i>Meleager</i>, but merely hunter and dog (so Furtw.-Urlichs,

this form of brow was a personal peculiarity of Alexander, as it recurs so often in his portraits.
It is seen in the head of Alexander on the sarcophagus from Sidon (either by a pupil of Lysippos or
by some sculptor under his influence), the reliefs from which portray the same subject as the bronze
group by Lysippos in Delphi mentioned by Pliny, <i>H. N.</i>, XXXIV, 64, dedicated by Krateros on
the occasion narrated by Plutarch, <i>Vita Alex. Magni</i>, 40, who states that the group was executed
conjointly with Leochares: see Hamdy Bey et Th. Reinach, <i>Une nécropole royale à Sidon</i>, 1892, Pl.
XXXIII, no. 6 (reproduced by Gardner, <i>Sculpt.</i>, Pl. LXXI). So far as I know, it occurs in Lysippan
work to a prominent degree only in likenesses of Alexander. We know that Lysippos created
the Alexander-type of head, as he alone could reproduce his manly and leonine air (<i>cf.</i> Plut., <i>de
Alex. M. fortuna aut virtute</i>, <i>oratio</i> II, 2, = p. 335). It is, to a less extent, present in the Azara head in
the Louvre, which, owing to its likeness to the head of the <i>Apoxyomenos</i>, used to be taken as the
nearest copy of the original by Lysippos.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2162"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2162"><span class="label">2162</span></a> It should be observed that the axis of the right eye in the head from Sparta droops slightly,
which causes the eyeball to turn in. This seems to me to be merely the result of imperfect
skill in modeling. It has a tendency to give to the face a look of greater intensity.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_2167"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2167"><span class="label">2167</span></a> The hair of the head from Sparta, like that of the <i>Agias</i> and the <i>Philandridas</i>, has not the expression
displayed in some Lysippan heads (notably in portraits of Alexander), nor the detail which we
should expect from Pliny’s statement that Lysippos excelled in his treatment of hair (<i>H. N.</i>,
XXXIV, 65; see next note). But the <i>Agias</i> and the <i>Philandridas</i> represent pancratiasts, and
here we should not expect such expression. In the <i>Agias</i>, the hair, even if lacking in detail, is
treated carefully and with variety.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2169"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2169"><span class="label">2169</span></a> I need hardly add that such an idealizing tendency should be carefully distinguished from the
deification of mortals which came into prominence after the time of Alexander, but existed in
Greece from the early fifth century B.&nbsp;C., at least. The case of heroizing the Thasian Theagenes,
who won at Olympia in boxing and the pankration in Ols. 75 and 76 (&#8239;=&#8239;480 and 475 B.&nbsp;C.), has
been discussed with similar ones in Ch. I, p. 35. But the fact that a victor wanted his statue to be
more or less assimilated to the ideal type of the hero, whom he regarded as his athletic prototype
and ideal, does not mean that he had any idea of looking upon himself as a god.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2170"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2170"><span class="label">2170</span></a> This would explain the simple, even sketchy, treatment of the closely cropped hair, just as in
the <i>Agias</i> and the <i>Philandridas</i>. The similarly parted lips of the Sparta head are certainly
more appropriate to an athlete represented as weary with his toil than to a youthful Herakles.
The slightly fierce expression of the face, augmented by the already noted imperfection in the
modeling of the right eyeball, recalls the γοργόν look characteristic of boxers and pancratiasts;
<i>cf. supra</i>, p. 317, n. 2. On the threatening eyes of contestants in general, see Xenophon, <i>Mem.</i>,
III, 10, 6–8, and <i>supra</i>, p. 59.
</p>
<p>
The head appears to me to be that of a boy of about sixteen years; its style is too early for a
victor in the boys’ pankration, as this event was not introduced at Olympia until the 145th
Olympiad (&#8239;=&#8239;200 B.&nbsp;C.): see Paus., V, 8.11 and Ph., 13. The wrestling match for boys was introduced
in 01. 37 (&#8239;=&#8239;632 B.&nbsp;C.): see Paus., V, 8.9, and Afr. Boys were first allowed to box in Ol.
41 (&#8239;=&#8239;616 B.&nbsp;C.): see Paus., <i>ibid.</i> (though Philostratos, 13, gives two traditions, Ols. 41 and 60).</p></div>

mentioned by P., IX, 35. 3, as holding the <i>Graces</i> in one hand. Plutarch, who cites Antikles and
Istros as his authorities, gives a better description of it in <i>de Musica</i>, 14; he says that it held the
bow in the right hand and the <i>Graces</i> playing on musical instruments in the left. A scholion on
Pindar, <i>Ol.</i>, XIV, 16, Boeckh, p. 293, mentions such an image of Apollo in Delphi, manifestly a
copy of the Delian one. Both the scholiast and Macrobius, <i>Saturnalia</i>, 1, 17. 13, place the bow
in the left hand and the <i>Graces</i> in the right, an arrangement confirmed by Athenian coins which
are copied from the replica of the statue in Athens (Bekker, <i>Anecdota gr.</i>, I, p. 299, ll. 8–9).

on Milesian coins, which represent the god nude, holding a stag in the right hand and a bow in the
left: see Overbeck, <i>Griech. Mythol.</i>, III, <i>Apollon</i>, Muenztafel I, 22 f. P., IX, 10.2, mentions a
cedar replica of the statue in Thebes. In the British Museum is a bronze, the so-called
Payne Knight statuette, a copy of the one on the coins; it is reproduced by Frazer, <i>l. c.</i>, p. 430,

<p><a id="Footnote_2311"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2311"><span class="label">2311</span></a> Hyde, p. 64. I here append three such passages: in V, 24.3, in speaking of the statue of the
<i>Zeus</i> of the Lacedæmonians, he says that it τοῦ ναοῦ δέ ἐστιν ἐν δεξιᾷ τοῦ μεγάλου Ζεὺς πρὸς ἀνατολὰς
ἡλίου, <i>i. e.</i>, at the southeast corner of the temple near where the pedestal was found (<i>cf.</i> <i>Inschr.
v. Ol.</i>, 252, and <i>Olympia, Ergebn.</i>, Textbd., I, p. 86); in V, 26.2, in speaking of the offerings of Mikythos,
he says that they stood παρὰ δὲ τοῦ ναοῦ τοῦ μεγάλου τὴν ἐν ἀριστερᾷ πλεύραν, <i>i. e.</i>, on the
northern side of the temple of Zeus, where most authorities find their foundations (<i>cf.</i> <i>Inschr. v. Ol.</i>,
267–269, and Flasch, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 1093); in VIII, 38.2, he says that Mount Lykaion is ἐν ἀριστερᾷ
δὲ τοῦ ἱεροῦ τῆς Δεσποίνης, <i>i. e.</i>, to the north of that temple. <i>Cf.</i> also V, 21.2. Professor Bluemner,
reviewing my monograph <i>de olymp. Stat.</i>, in the <i>Berl. Philol. Wochenschr.</i>, XXIV, 1904,
col. 1382, objects to my interpretation of ἐν δεξιᾷ, and admits not one but three possibilities: (<i>a</i>)
of the temple <i>pro persona</i>, <i>i. e.</i>, its south side; (<i>b</i>) of a spectator facing the chief, <i>i. e.</i>, east front,
the northern half of the space before it; (<i>c</i>) of a spectator with his back to this front, <i>i. e.</i>, the
southern half of this space. But if Pausanias had meant either of the two latter, he would have
said πρὸ τοῦ ναοῦ, as in VIII, 37.2, κατὰ τὸν ναόν, <i>cf.</i> V, 15.3, or ἀντικρὺ τοῦ ναοῦ, <i>cf.</i> V, 27.1.</p></div>

the name of Akestorides of Alexandria Troas, placing his statue next to that of Agemachos
(118) of similar date, the only other Asiatic in this part of the Altis. Foerster, 501, dates
Akestorides wrongly in the second century B.&nbsp;C. (on the basis of Furtwaengler, <i>A. M.</i>, V, 1880,
p. 30, n. 2, end), although the inscription from the base is referred by Dittenberger to the end of
the third; Agemachos won in Ol. 147 (&#8239;=&#8239;192 B.&nbsp;C.); I have therefore dated Akestorides tentatively

Roehl (<i>I. G. A.</i>, no. 355 and Add., p. 182) referred an inscription on two marble fragments found

the temple of Zeus, to the victor Agiadas (103); Dittenberger (<i>cf.</i> <i>Inschr. v. Ol.</i>, no. 150) and others
have rightly rejected this ascription. Similarly the inscribed base of the statue of Areus (105 b),
son of Akrotatos, King of Sparta, found in the Heraion (see <i>Inschr. v. Ol.</i>, no. 308), belongs
rather to the second statue of Areus (148 a) dedicated by Ptolemy Philadelphus; <i>cf.</i> Hyde, pp.
44–45. I have also referred the second inscription of the artist Pythagoras (<i>Inschr. v. Ol.</i>, no.
145) found in the Leonidaion, to the statue of Astylos (110), because of its similarity to that
on the base of the statue of Euthymos (56) likewise by Pythagoras: <i>ibid.</i>, pp. 47–48.</p></div>

The pedestal of the statue of Paianios (167) was found behind the south side of the Echo Colonnade

west of the Altis are the ruins of two parallel walls, the inner Greek, the outer Roman; the original
South wall of the Altis ran along the line of the South Terrace wall, the later Roman wall
(dating from Nero’s time) to the south of it. Thus in Pausanias’ day, the ἔσοδος πομπική was
opposite the Leonidaion. In two other passages, however, it appears to be at the southeast corner
of the Altis (V, 15.7; VI, 20.7). R. Heberdey (in <i>Eranos Vindobonensis</i>, 1893, pp. 34–47)
explains this discrepancy by saying that Pausanias, in mentioning the southwestern entrance,
is writing from his own observation after the Roman extension, and in the other passages is
copying from other writers who wrote before that extension. Doerpfeld’s explanation, however,
is better: in the Roman extension a gate was built at the southwest corner of the new West wall
superseding the older southeast entrance. Processions still passed along the same way, but were
now <i>inside</i> the Altis, the great gateway of Nero at the southeast corner being given up after his
death. <i>Cf.</i> Frazer, III, pp. 570–572; Hitz.-Bluemn., II, 2, pp. 375–6.</p></div>

(<i>l. c.</i>, pp. 94 f.) placed the older altar of Zeus (who was at first worshiped in common with Hera)
between the Heraion and Pelopion (as Puchstein also did). He believed that later, however, after
the building of the temple of Zeus and the Pelopion, the altar was moved east of both and stood
somewhere northwest of the elliptical depression, where Pausanias saw it. He explained the lack
of remains on the theory that the Christians would completely destroy this, the chief pagan altar.
But it is difficult to see why the few Christian settlers in this out of the way place should have
shown any such anger. Doerpfeld (<i>Ergebn. v. Ol.</i>, Textbd., II, <i>Baudenkmaeler</i>, p. 163) suggested that
it may have stood south of the <i>Exedra</i> of Herodes Attikos, where its site must certainly be sought.</p></div>

should have destroyed it so completely, they assume that Pausanias made a mistake in his directions.

Pausanias, after ending the <i>periegesis</i> of the altars, adds one more, that of “Zeus Horkios,” which
stood in the Council House, though he had already passed this point twice without mentioning the

<p><a id="Footnote_2477"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2477"><span class="label">2477</span></a> Foerster assumed that the statue by Myron stood in Olympia. Against this view, see Furtwaengler
(<i>Mw.</i>, p. 379, n. 5), Kalkmann (<i>Jb.</i>, X, 1895, p. 56, and XI, 1896, p. 197), Studniczka
(article cited in note on Theagenes preceding), Brunn (<i>Sitzb. Muen. Akad.</i>, 1880, pp. 474 f.).
Benndorf (<i>de anthol. Gr. Epigram.</i>, 1862, 15, n. 1) thought it more probable that the statue stood
formerly at Olympia, but in the time of Pausanias was in Rome. Thus it is best to assume two
statues, the one in Argos not by Myron. Brunn (p. 475) showed that Ladas was a Spartan because
of P., III, 21. I and VIII, 12.5; Benndorf (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 13) thought that he was an Argive. Kuhnert
(<i>Jahrbuecher f. cl. Philol.</i>, Supplbd., XIV, p. 269 n. 13) argued that the Argive statue was set up
by the Argive state, an improbable assumption if Ladas were a Spartan. A different Ladas is
the stade runner from Aigion, mentioned by P., III, 21.1, and X, 23.14.</p></div>

before the middle of the fifth century B.&nbsp;C.; K. K. Smith (<i>Class. Phil.</i>, 1910, pp. 169–174)
